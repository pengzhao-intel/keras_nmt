<seg id=1> This Week's Eurozone Economic Indicators to Show Continuous Economic Weakening in Europe </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Economists said that Eurozone economic indicators to be released this week will provide further evidence of weak economic confidence and slowing economic output, while British data is expected to show a pick-up in industrial activities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> They said economic output data from the largest Eurozone countries will continue to be volatile from one month to the next, but the longer-term trend of output will point to slowing economic growth. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> The most important economic indicators of the week will be in Germany, where the ZEW institute's economic expectations index, which is due on the 7th and is closely watched by the market, will offer Europe its first evidence of economic confidence in December. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> The ZEW index fell sharply to 13.9 in November from 31.3 the previous month. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Economists said the significant appreciation of the Euro will have continued to weigh on economic confidence in the latest survey, so there is no reason to expect any rebound in the economic expectations index. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> "Given that the main factors driving down economic confidence, including the Euro's appreciation, uncertainty over global growth and the weak labor market and worsening unemployment in Germany, have remained a drag on future growth expectations over the December survey period, a strong rebound is unlikely," BNP's economists said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> According to a survey among economists conducted by AFX News, the AFP financial news subsidiary, the index will drop again to 11.0 in December from 13.9 in the previous month. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> However, Teather of UBS investment bank said Germany's ZEW economic expectations index could drop as far as zero in December. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> "Expectations of future German economic activity, as reflected in the ZEW survey of analysts and financial market participants, will continue to fall in our view," said Teather. </seg>

<seg id=1> Ukraine Crisis Causing Tensions between East and West to Dominate OSCE Meeting </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Russia has been accusing the West of interfering in the affairs of Eastern Europe, which has gradually become a focus due to the political crisis in Ukraine and is expected to top the agenda of the annual ministerial meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which will open tomorrow. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Russia is irritated by the creeping influence of the West into corners of Europe it previously considered its backyard, like the Baltic states, Georgia and central Asia. As a result, the recent incident in Ukraine is likely to dominate the discussions of the two-day OSCE meeting in the Bulgarian capital of Sofia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Ukraine's Supreme Court has made a dramatic ruling to order a re-voting of the recent second-round presidential election. And before this, the European Union had called on member states of the OSCE to ask their observers to get ready for "the quickest and efficient actions". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> According to European sources, the number of OSCE observers will increase to 1,000 from the original 600 in Ukraine's re-election scheduled for December 26th. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> US Secretary of State Powell will attend OSCE's annual meeting, which is perhaps his last foreign tour before leaving office. </seg>
<seg id=7> Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov, French Foreign Minister Barnier, British Foreign Minister Straw and German Foreign Minister Fischer will also be attending the meeting. </seg>

<seg id=1> Bush's Major Test: Intelligence Reform Bill to Face Congressional Vote this Week </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> The intelligence reform bill the US congress will take efforts to pass this week is part of an ambitious second-term agenda pushed by Republican President Bush, whose support level among Republican congressmen will be his first major test after re-election. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> In a newspaper interview yesterday, Kean, the Republican who led the investigation into the September 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington, said the issue with the intelligence reform bill was that it has to be passed by the Congress and that the matter itself augurs ill for bipartisan cooperation and the president's domestic agenda. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> "Congress becomes dysfunctional if the president and Congress can't get these big issues taken care of, and then we're all in trouble," Kean said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> "It'll be a long time before there's another bill with the support of the Republican and Democratic leadership in both houses and the support of 80% of the American people in the polls," he told The New York Daily News. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Several lawmakers said yesterday that failure of the groundbreaking reform bill could delay overhaul of America's antiquated spy network by months, years or kill it altogether. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> The top Democrat on the House of Representatives' Intelligence Committee, Harman, yesterday told CNN television that "if the bill isn't passed this week, it dies". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Congress will try again on the 6th and 7th to pass the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 before adjourning until early next year. </seg>
<seg id=9> If lawmakers fail, the entire bill will be discarded and need to be rewritten in the Congress' 2005 session. </seg>

<seg id=1> Ukraine's Opposition Strongly Opposes Large Constitutional Amendment to Dilute Presidential Powers </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Ukraine's pro-West opposition firmly insisted today that they would not accept the constitutional reform pushed by outgoing Ukrainian President Kuchma before the second round presidential re-election. </seg>
<seg id=3> The constitutional reform will dilute most of the president's powers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> With the November 21st vote declared invalid by the Supreme Court because of massive vote fraud in the second-round presidential elections and a new date of re-election set by the Central Election Commission for December 26, opposition leader Yushchenko is locked in a fresh standoff with Kuchma. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> "If the constitutional amendment is passed in its current form, all the powers of the president would be transferred to the parliament. This would be unacceptable," said Timoshenko, an ally of Yushchenko. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> "We want the president to be able to name the head of the intelligence agency and the prosecutor general so we can fight corruption and get rid of the clans that dominate Ukraine's political and business life," she told reporters. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Kuchma, who keeps close ties to Russia, had pushed for constitutional changes before the re-election amid fears that the opposition could win the presidential election. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Opposition lawmakers yesterday refused to vote for government-proposed constitutional changes and the parliament adjourned for 10 days. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> According to the constitutional amendment, the power to appoint all top posts excepting the prime minister, defense and foreign ministers would be transferred from the president to the parliament, where pro-government forces currently have close to a majority. </seg>

<seg id=1> Ukraine's Political Crisis Enters Third Week with Opposition Calling for Continuous Protest </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> The chaos caused by Ukraine's presidential election has entered its third week. Opposition leader Yushchenko today called on his supporters to continue the street protests and block the presidential palace and government buildings unless outgoing President Kuchma dismisses Prime Minister Yanukovych and his cabinet members and takes actions to ensure the fairness of the upcoming presidential reelection. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Tens of thousands of Yushchenko's supporters have gathered in the capital of Kiev for two weeks, blocking the government buildings and encamping themselves on major avenues designed by Soviet experts to hold military parades. The people power they have demonstrated has forced the Supreme Court to annul the second round of presidential election of December 21st and the Central Election Commission to order a reelection for December 26th. The parliament has approved the dismissal of Yanukovych, but Kuchma, Yanukovych's mentor, has not signed the administrative decree to fire his successor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Yushchenko told supporters gathered at the capital's Independence Square this evening that Kuchma should dismiss his government, and reshuffle the Central Election Commission. In addition, both the parliament and Kuchma should agree to amend the election law to prevent election fraud. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> "Before these decisions are made, the issue of blockade on government buildings and the presidential palace will not be discussed," he said, starting his campaign for the December 26 election. </seg>
<seg id=6> "Over the past 14 days, the square has shown the love for Ukraine and the civil consciousness of millions of Ukrainian people who can defend their own choice." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> "We are undergoing a fight between good and evil. The world is applauding our victory and is proud of Ukraine," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> As the opposition is putting more pressure on the ruling authority backed by Moscow and Yushchenko and Kuchma are once again locked in a standoff of constitutional reform, Polish President Kwasniewski, Lithuanian President Adamkus and Russian envoy Gryszlov are scheduled to arrive in Kiev on the 6th for another round of mediation. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=2> Egypt says a new framework is expected to come into being for the Middle East peace agreement. </seg>
<seg id=3> It also says it is likely to return its ambassador to Israel in the near future to restore the full diplomatic ties severed four years ago. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Quoting "high-level" Egyptian sources, Egypt's state news agency, the Middle East News Agency (MENA), said parties in the search for a peace plan have gradually reached an understanding that could lead to a comprehensive reconciliation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> "An important understanding has been reached by Egypt, Israel, the Palestinians and the significant international parties, such as the United States and the European Union, agreeing in principle on a comprehensive solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict," MENA said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Following the death last month of veteran Palestinian leader Arafat, the international community has revitalized its efforts to advance towards a final Middle East peace policy in a bid to end at an early date years of bloody conflict between Israel and Palestine. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> MENA said officials expect that "preparations would take place until July, after which political action will begin". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> MENA said it will be followed by a conference in Washington attended by all parties concerned with the peace process, notably Israel and Palestine, as well as Egypt, the United States, Russia and several European countries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Topics of the meeting are expected to include a "bilateral ceasefire" and the Palestinian Authority "putting a stop to anti-Israeli attacks and consolidating its control over the situation in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> For this point, MENA said Israeli Prime Minister Sharon has promised to "stop Israeli military operations against the Palestinians insofar as they continue to respect the ceasefire deal and control their territory." </seg>

<seg id=1> One Billion Children Suffer from War, Poverty and AIDS </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) pointed out today in its annual report that more than 1 billion children, half of the world's population of children, suffer from poverty, war and the scourge of AIDS. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> UNICEF says the rights of children to a healthy and protected upbringing, as laid out in the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child, are regularly imperiled, due in part to the failure of governments to carry out human rights and economic reforms. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> UNICEF Executive Director Bellamy pointed out during the release of the report in London that "when half the world's children are growing up hungry and unhealthy, when schools have become targets of attacks and whole villages are being emptied by AIDS, we've failed to deliver on the promise of childhood". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> "Too many governments are making deliberate choices that actually hurt childhood," Bellamy added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> UNICEF has joined hands with researchers from Britain's London School of Economics and Bristol University to compile statistics which paint a terrible portrait of children at risk in most part of the world. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Researchers have found that around 640 million children lack adequate shelter, 400 million have no access to safe water, 270 million have no access to health care services and 140 million (mostly girls) have never been to school in the world. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Researchers point out that even worse is that at least 700 million children suffer from various forms of "severe deprivation", which also includes a lack of access to information and public sanitation facilities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> The 10th annual UNICEF report released today points out that war and AIDS have destroyed networks that normally protect children and at times turned them into direct victims of war and AIDS. </seg>

<seg id=1> EU Resists Chinese Pressure to Lift Arms Embargo </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> The European Union today rebuffed pressure for a quick end to the arms embargo on China from Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, but said it was working towards lifting the 15-year-old ban. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The EU Dutch presidency made the remarks following a China-EU summit. </seg>
<seg id=4> The Netherlands says it cannot speculate how the EU will end the embargo. </seg>
<seg id=5> The EU imposed the arms ban on Beijing after the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Although the arms embargo overshadowed the China-EU summit, the two sides have signed several trade and other agreements. </seg>
<seg id=7> Both China and the EU claim that such deals have strengthened their "strategic partnership". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> "The EU side has confirmed its political will to continue to work towards lifting the embargo," said the EU in a joint statement made after the summit with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> The statement points out that the Chinese delegation "welcomes the positive signal and considers it beneficial to the sound development of the comprehensive strategic partnership between China and the EU." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Wen Jiabao didn't hide his displeasure at a press conference following the summit. He said the ban "does not reflect the partnership between China and the EU". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> "The embargo is a result of the Cold War and does not reflect the present situation nor the partnership between China and the EU," Wen Jiabao said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> A group of EU countries led by France is pushing for the arms ban to be lifted, saying the ban is outdated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=13> But some in the EU worry that without a strengthened set of EU rules, a lifting of the embargo could open the floodgates to arms sales which could improve China's military strength. </seg>

<seg id=1> Preliminary Research Finds Folic Acid May Be Linked to Breast Cancer But Link Not Confirmed </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> A new health study points out that folic acid, a B vitamin widely taken by pregnant women to protect against birth defects, has been linked to an increased risk of breast cancer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> But the researchers say their results could merely be the result of chance, as other studies have suggested that folic acid actually reduces the risk of breast cancer, so they urge pregnant women to continue taking the supplement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Folic acid, found naturally in dark, leafy vegetables, is known to be a key aid in the growth of the fetus. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Researchers from the universities of Bristol and Aberdeen followed 3,000 women who in the 1960s were given supplements of either five milligrams or 0.2 milligrams of folate, or a placebo, mostly during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> The study published in the British Medical Journal says that by September 2002, breast cancer rates were twice as high for those who took the five-milligram supplement as for those who took the placebo. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> One of the researchers, Ness, has stressed the results were merely "preliminary¡­ intended to point the way towards further research". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> "It's entirely possible that this is a chance finding, so further scientific studies are required to examine the association, if there is one, before we reach any conclusions," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Ness says women planning to become pregnant should still take folic acid supplements. </seg>
<seg id=10> He says there is a "considerable difference between the trial" and current dosage recommendations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> According to British health guidelines, women hoping to become pregnant and those in the first trimester of their pregnancy should take a 0.4-microgram daily supplement of folic acid ¨C more than 10 times smaller than the doses given to women in the study. </seg>

<seg id=2> Movie director Oliver Stone is in Istanbul today promoting the new film "Alexander" and hoping to repair an old rift with Turkey. </seg>
<seg id=3> His screenplay for the classic "Midnight Express" has been criticized for tarnishing the image of Turkey. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=4> "I never intended it to be against Turkey. It was against injustice everywhere," he told AFP in an exclusive interview. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> The film was based on the memoirs of Billy Hayes. </seg>
<seg id=7> Hayes, a young American, was sentenced to 30 years in jail in Turkey after a protracted legal saga that began when he was caught at Istanbul Airport trying to smuggle hashish out of the country. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=2> Japan's economy may be heading towards a slowdown in 2005 as a stronger yen and a growing disparity between rich and poor threaten to spoil the harmonious atmosphere enjoyed in the early part of this year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> While huge corporate profits and stronger consumer spending brought confidence back to Japan this year after a decade of stagnation, analysts now pin their hopes on a booming China to sustain economic growth despite growing political tensions between Japan and China. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> The evidence is mounting that Japan's economy could slump briefly in early 2005, especially if industrial production continues to decline as manufacturers adjust stock inventories to avoid a glut. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Under a recently adopted new data methodology, Japan's economy actually contracted slightly in the April-June quarter and grew only 0.1% in the July-September quarter, narrowly avoiding a technical recession. </seg>

<seg id=1> French Foreign Minister: Middle East Peace Process to Test French-US Ties </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> After a meeting with US Secretary of State Powell today, French Foreign Minister Barnier said that resuming Middle East peace talks would be a "test" of their trans-Atlantic relationship. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Following the death of Palestinian leader Arafat, France called for the rapid convening of an international conference to push forward the Israeli-Palestinian peace process but there was no sign of agreement between Barnier and Powell after their meeting. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Barnier flew into Washington from Paris for a lightning round of talks with Powell and his designated successor, National Security Adviser Rice, before turning around and heading to Brussels for a European Union summit. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Both Paris and Washington have agreed to repair relations strained by the US invasion of Iraq last year, but differences remain clear over how to best resolve the Middle East impasse. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> "We want to improve future relations between France and America and Europe and America," said Barnier, after a short meeting with US Secretary of State Powell. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> "I think the test at the heart of this relationship is our ability to launch the peace process between Palestinians and Israelis," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Barnier called early this week for an early international conference on the Middle East to take advantage of what he termed a "window of opportunity" created after Arafat's death last month. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> But Powell has not made any promise. </seg>
<seg id=10> He said the two had spoken of a British plan to hold a meeting bringing in the Palestinians but did not mention if a broader international meeting would be held. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> US officials say they have made it their priority to promote the Israeli-Palestinian peace to ensure smooth Palestinian elections next month. </seg>
<seg id=12> The election will produce a leader who could rein in Islamic militants and resume talks with Israel. </seg>

<seg id=2> Japan's Foreign Minister Nobutaka Machimura proposed today that Japan and South Korea hold talks on a free trade agreement (FTA) as early as January next year. </seg>
<seg id=3> Jiji Press reports that during a meeting with the South Korean Foreign and Commercial Minister, Ban Ki-Moon, in the southern Japanese city of Ibusuki in Kagoshima county, Machimura said the two sides should resume talks as soon as possible, since both Tokyo and Seoul wish to conclude the FTA by the end of 2005. </seg>

<seg id=4> The talks between Machimura and Ban Ki-Moon followed the summit of the 17th between Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and South Korean President Roh Moo-Hyun, who urged Tokyo to be cautious over imposing economic sanctions against North Korea. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=2> Thai Prime Minister Thaksin is confident he will win a second four-year term heading into 2005 but his reputation has been tarnished by a failure to quell a deadly separatist insurgency. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> With national elections slated for February 6 next year, Thaksin and his political adversaries are gearing up for a battle which most analysts expect him to win despite the serious violence and bird flu epidemic in the south this year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> A total of 12 people died this year from bird flu in Thailand. The bird flu swept across much of Asia but was particularly devastating in Thailand, where the government admitted it had "made mistakes" in its handling of the epidemic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> However, the health concern is unlikely to unseat Thaksin. Instead, many are asking only how thorough his victory will be, and what will it mean for the Muslim insurgency in the southern provinces. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> "The phenomenon here is that no matter how one looks at Thaksin, he has managed to capture popularity for the time being," Kraisak, Chairman of the Senate's Committee on Foreign Affairs told the AFP. </seg>

<seg id=2> Late Palestinian leader Arafat's Cabinet Secretary Abdelrahman reveals that Arafat may have been poisoned one year ago when he received a delegation of supporters in his Ramallah headquarters. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> "Something strange happened to Arafat around a year ago. It was on September 25, 2003," Abdelrahman told Al-Hayat newspaper. </seg>
<seg id=4> "The president shook hands with around 30 supporters before leaving to vomit. </seg>
<seg id=5> It was from that moment that the president's health started slowly deteriorating." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Arafat died in a French hospital of an unknown illness on November 11. </seg>
<seg id=7> Some senior Palestinian officials have suggested the veteran leader had been poisoned. </seg>
<seg id=8> However, French doctors have insisted there was no medical basis for such allegations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Two weeks before the delegation's call on Arafat mentioned by Abdelrahman, the Israeli Prime Minister Sharon's cabinet had just taken a decision to remove Arafat, although without specifying by what means. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> The Israeli threat had prompted expressions of support for Arafat, who thereafter received the visit of several delegations of supporters. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=11> "Arafat shook hands with people, who had come to express solidarity with him in his confinement by Israel," Abdelrahman recalled. </seg>

<seg id=2> US Secretary of State Colin Powell today predicted a Shiite victory in the Iraqi elections but he also assuaged concerns it could bolster Iranian influence inside the country because of the past feud between Iraqi and Iranian Shias. </seg>

<seg id=1> Political Interference in NHK Program? War of Words Erupts in Japanese Media </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Allegations that the public-owned Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK) had been pressured by politicians several years ago to soft-pedal a program on Japan's legacy of sexual enslavement during World War II have pitted liberal Japanese media against their conservative counterparts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Liberal Japanese media have attacked NHK for leaving out large portions of interviews it had conducted with mostly critics of Japan's wartime conduct and victims of sex slavery, allegedly after discussions with senior political leaders. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> But conservative newspapers have defended NHK's editing of the program, saying that NHK executives have a duty to ensure the fairness and objectiveness of their programs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> The controversy erupted last week over a 2001 program that featured a mock trial on sex slavery of comfort women in the Japanese military during the war. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> The trial, held by a women's rights group in Tokyo in December 2000, found the late Emperor Hirohito guilty of allowing the slavery of comfort women during Japan's occupation of Asian nations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Historians say at least 200,000 young women, mostly Korean but also from Taiwan, China, the Philippines and Indonesia, were forced to serve as comfort women in frontline Japanese army brothels during the war. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> The program's chief producer Satoru Nagai held a tearful news conference on the 13th noting that just before the program was to be aired senior NHK officials had met with lawmakers of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, Shinzo Abe and Shoichi Nakagawa, who expressed concerns over the program. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Nagai said top NHK officials then re-edited and shortened the program. </seg>
<seg id=10> "NHK bowed to political pressure," he said. </seg>

<seg id=7> Economists point out that core inflation, which excludes food, energy, tobacco and alcohol prices, has remained at a 1.6-2% range for the past two years. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Zhao Ziyang was dismissed from office for opposing the military suppression of the 1989 democracy movement at Tiananmen Square. He was put under house arrest and remained so until his death this morning at a Beijing hospital at the age of 85. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency report of December 6th from Hangzhou (by Pan Yifeng and Xu Qun) - China's largest seawater desalination project in the mainland so far, with a daily production capacity of 10,000 tons, is to be kicked off in the Putuo District of Zhoushan city in Zhejiang Province. </seg>
<seg id=3> For residents in Zhoushan long accustomed to water shortages, the seawater surging beside them for hundreds of thousands of years will soon become clean and sweet tap water running into thousands of homes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> According to relevant authorities, a cooperation agreement on a seawater desalination project with a daily production capacity of 10,000 tons has recently been signed between the Hangzhou Development Center of Water Treatment Technology under the State Oceanic Administration and the Liuheng Township government of Zhoushan city. </seg>
<seg id=5> The project costs 50 million Yuan and has a daily production capacity of 10,000 tons of fresh water. It is presently the largest seawater desalination project in the mainland. The first-stage of construction is expected to be completed next year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Zhoushan is one of Chinese cities suffering from a serious water shortage. </seg>
<seg id=7> The entire city consists of 1,390 islands. The per capita fresh water is 601 cubic meters, which equals to only 25.4% of the per capita average in Zhejiang Province. The problem of drinking water shortages has long plagued residents of the island city. </seg>
<seg id=8> Taking Liuheng Township in Putuo District as an example, some 1,500 tons of fresh water have to be transported every day into the town from a neighboring one at a cost of over 10 Yuan per ton. </seg>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Toledo pointed out that although many issues need to be resolved in the Andean Community, Latin America integration over the last few years has witnessed much progress. The establishment of the South American Community will be announced here on the 8th at the 3rd South American Leaders' Summit. </seg>
<seg id=8> He expressed his belief that the establishment of this new regional organization will play a key role in promoting regional political, economic and social development. </seg>

<seg id=1> Three Gorges Project's Underground Powerhouse to Begin Construction </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency report of December 8th from Wuhan (by staff reporter Shi Yongfeng) - The principal part of the underground powerhouse of the Three Gorges Project began inviting bids for the first time on December 8th, which preludes the construction of the Three Gorges underground power plant. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The Three Gorges Project design calls for installation of 26 700-MW water turbo generator units with an installation capacity of 18,200 MW. After their full operation, the units will generate an annual average of 84.7 billion kilowatt-hours. </seg>
<seg id=4> To further tap its power generation potential, the Three Gorges Project has reserved a location for the construction of an underground power station in its preliminary design. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> According to the chief from the China Yangtze River Three Gorges Project Development Corporation, the Three Gorges underground power station is located in mountains to the right side of the Three Gorges Dam. Major structures include an intake tower, diversion canal, main plant buildings, tailrace systems, bus shafts, and a 500-KV transformer substation. </seg>
<seg id=6> Six 700-MW power generation units will be installed in the underground power station. </seg>
<seg id=7> As a result, the total number of generating units in Three Gorges Project will increase from 26 to 32 and the installed capacity will increase from 18,200 MW to 22,400 MW, dramatically improving the power generation capability of the Three Gorges Project. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Flood prevention is a top priority in the construction of the Three Gorges Project. </seg>
<seg id=9> According to the operation and control plan of the Three Gorges Reservoir, the water level of the Three Gorges Reservoir will need to be lowered from its normal level of 175 meters to the flood prevention level of 145 meters before the start of flooding season each year. </seg>
<seg id=10> As a result, the construction of the underground power station will raise the water exploitation index of the Three Gorges Reservoir, reducing abandonment of water, increasing power generation capacity and maximizing the station's non-flood peak adjustment period when abandonment of water is not necessary. </seg>
<seg id=11> At present, the preparatory projects such as the excavation and construction work of the underground power station's tributary canals, tailrace canals and supporting structures have already begun. </seg>
<seg id=12> Sources say the underground power station will be fully completed and operational at the end of 2008. </seg>

<seg id=3> On December 11th 1929, Deng Xiaoping and Zhang Yunyi led and launched the renowned Bai Se Uprising and founded the Youjiang Revolutionary Base and the 7th Army of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> A recent poll conducted by the relevant organizations in Shanghai showed that minors spend an average of 1.17, 1.05 and 0.99 hours each day on extracurricular books, TV and the Internet. About half of their after-school time is spent on the media, which, as a brand-new social force, has become a factor that can't be neglected in minors' growth and development. </seg>

<seg id=5> Chen Tianqiao, President, Shanghai ShanDa Networking (Group) Co., Ltd. said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> While the media may offer beneficial conditions for the healthy development of minors, due to the needs of market competition and economic benefits as well as a lack of quality with some media people, the viewpoints in published articles may easily mislead minors in their thinking and values. Even worse is the dissemination of violence and pornography in some media. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> At present, there are more than 2,000 TV channels and over 1,500 radio frequencies with 1,868 radio programs. The number of domestic Internet users has reached 87 million. </seg>

<seg id=8> Officials of the forum say that the establishment of a spokesman system for minors will offer authoritative investigation data on the current development and problems of young people and change the current "false voices" of the media to create a healthy and favorable environment of public opinions for minors' development. </seg>

<seg id=1> (International) UN Warns of Rise in Global Drug-Related Deaths in 2005 </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua New Agency report of December 17th from Vienna (by staff reporter Song Guocheng) - The Executive Director of the UN Office of Drug Control and Crime Prevention, Costa, warned in a press statement on the 17th that due to the production increase of Heroin in Afghanistan, the world's black market price of Heroin was expected to stabilize with a concurrent increase in drug purity, which is expected to result in more deaths of drug users. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Costa has issued warnings to health and anti-drug officials in Europe and its neighboring countries, calling on them to pay attention to the latest trends in Afghanistan's drug cultivation and in international drug-related crimes, and calling on them to take appropriate preventive measures. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> According to statistics by the Vienna-based UN Office of Drug Control and Crime Prevention, Heroin production in Afghanistan dropped by 94% in 2001 when opium plantation was forbidden in the country. In the following year, Heroin's degree of purity in Europe's black market decreased by 50%. </seg>
<seg id=5> Between 2000 and 2002, drug-related deaths in Europe dropped by 20%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Costa says that compared with 2003, the plantation area of opium in Afghanistan has increased by 64% this year with Heroin's production reaching up to 500 tons; higher than the global black market's one-year trade volume. The trend indicates that the degree of drug purity in the world will rise and drug-related deaths will increase accordingly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Costa says the drug source in Afghanistan is posing a "clear and real threat" to the world's anti-drug efforts. The increase of Heroin supply in the black market means the "death verdict" for drug users. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> It is estimated that around 100,000 people die in the world each year from drug overuse. </seg>

<seg id=1> National Top-Level Node for Domain Names to Settle in Shanghai </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency report of December 21st from Shanghai (by staff reporters Feng Yizhen and Chen Haiyu) - The China Internet Information Center and Shanghai Information Industry (Group) Company Limited signed a deal on the 21st regarding the establishment of a national top-level node for domain names in Shanghai. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Domain names are the basis of communications on which all Internet sites use for E-Business, E-Government, and other applications. At present, they are widely used as Internet addresses. </seg>
<seg id=4> People wishing to visit websites or send or receive emails must first enter a domain name.  The information transfer is then realized through the domain name system's analysis service which switches the domain name to an IP address to reach the website's servers. </seg>
<seg id=5> The domain name system is like a "nerve system" controlling information transfers on the Internet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> According to Mao Wei, Director of the China Internet Information Center which is in charge of China's national top-level domain name system, the number of China's Internet users has exceeded 90 million so far, ranking second in the world while the number of websites has surpassed 650,000. </seg>
<seg id=7> The analysis volume of domain names goes along with the use of the Internet. The analysis volume of domain names has quickly risen with the speedy development of the Internet. </seg>
<seg id=8> The number of domain name registrations ending with "dot CN" increases by 10,000 every month, and has reached 430,000 so far. </seg>
<seg id=9> The national top-level domain name server operated and managed by the China Internet Information Center processes more than 380 million domain name analysis requests each day, with an average of over 4,400 requests per second and more than 8,000 at peak times. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Facing the fast development of the Internet, the China Internet Information Center, the regulatory body in China for registration of domain names, has reevaluated 4 original national top-level nodes for domain names and redeployed its top-level nodes for dot-CN domain names based on such assessment. </seg>
<seg id=11> In accordance with its Internet development level and the software and hardware conditions of the user units, Shanghai has been selected as the location for installing the national top-level node for domain names. </seg>
<seg id=12> Sources say there are 45,000 dot-CN domain names in Shanghai so far, with Internet prevalence reaching 26.6% and both it's Internet prevalence and application levels leading the country. </seg>
<seg id=13> There are 130,000 more dot-CN domain names and 230,000 websites in the Eastern China regions neighboring Shanghai, with an advanced development level. </seg>
<seg id=14> As a result, Shanghai has been chosen as the first node in the redeployment plan. </seg>

<seg id=1> China Becomes World's Largest Hard Alloy Producer </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency report of December 22nd from Nanchang (by staff reporters Yang Yuanyuan and Li Xingwen) - China's hard alloy industry has seen rapid development over the past several years with annual output now exceeding 1/3 of the world's total. In terms of scale and output, China has become the largest hard alloy producer in the world, having a large variety of hard alloy products and the ability to produce most of them. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> This was learned on the 22nd by the reporters from the ongoing China Ganzhou Tungsten Industry Development Strategy Seminar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Hard alloy is called "industrial teeth". Due to its high hardness and durability, it is used for cutting tools, high-tension tools as well as for mining and road-building machinery. The development of the hard alloy industry plays a key role in the development of the whole tungsten industry. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Sources say that China's hard alloy sector started from scratch in the 1950s and has continued its development, winning outstanding achievements in the process. </seg>
<seg id=6> In the early 1980s, the world's annual hard alloy output was 25,000 tons while China's annual output was around 5,000 tons. Since the beginning of the 21st century, the world's annual hard alloy output has reached 38,000 tons while China's output has rapidly reached 15,000 tons, accounting for more than 1/3 of the world's total. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Marked progress has also been made in China's hard alloy exports. </seg>
<seg id=8> In 1986, China's hard alloy exports were only 100 tons but in 2003, exports reached 2,500 tons. This year exports are expected to exceed 3,000 tons, accounting for 1/3 of the world's hard alloy market trade, a share similar to that of its output. The foreign exchange earned through hard alloy exports has increased to $70 million annually from under $4 million in the past. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency report of December 23rd from Beijing (by staff reporter Jiang Guocheng) - Sources from the China representative office of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said on the 23rd that the ADB has recently approved a $117.4 million loan to support the construction of a power plant in southern Shanxi Province, which will generate power by utilizing methane produced in coal mining. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The coalbed methane development demonstration project will utilize the latest technologies to boost coalbed and coalmine methane production to fuel a 120-megawatt power plant to be built soon. </seg>
<seg id=4> According to the project plan, it will offer at least 166 million cubic meters of coalbed methane annually to about 90,000 residential, industrial and commercial consumers after its completion in 2008. </seg>
<seg id=5> Some 410,000 people in the Jincheng area will benefit. </seg>
<seg id=6> Shanxi's coal production accounts for around 1/3 of the nation's total. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> The total cost of the project is estimated at $237 million, with the Japan Bank for International Cooperation offering a loan of $20 million and China Construction Bank offering a loan of $37.86 million. </seg>
<seg id=8> The Jincheng municipal government and two of the local mining/industrial groups will provide equity capital totaling $61.24 million. </seg>
<seg id=9> The US Trade and Development Agency has also provided a $500,000 grant. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Methane captured from surface well while drilling an underground coal mine is called coalbed methane while methane generated from underground coalmining operations is called coalmine methane. </seg>
<seg id=11> Methane is highly explosive and needs to be drained before mining operations to ensure safe working conditions. </seg>
<seg id=12> Removal, capture and use of methane will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help ease global warming and climate changes. </seg>
<seg id=13> Methane is 21 times more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas. </seg>
<seg id=14> Using methane to replace coal can also increase the use of clean fuel, improve coalmine efficiency, and result in cleaner air. </seg>
<seg id=15> Hassing, an ADB principal project specialist, says the project is expected to result in some 4.5 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent of greenhouse gas emission reductions. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency report of December 24th from Jerusalem - Director of the Israel Museum, James Snyder, said on the 24th that an ivory pomegranate, a most precious possession of the museum, had been recently confirmed as a fake. </seg>
<seg id=3> The ivory pomegranate was once thought to be the only relic discovered so far of King Solomon time's First Temple. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Snyder said in a statement that the Israeli authority had conducted a careful appraisal of the thumb-sized ivory pomegranate. </seg>
<seg id=5> Experts have found that it is a cultural relic dating to the Bronze Period, much earlier than the First Temple Period of the Jewish people. </seg>
<seg id=6> The Hebrew inscription on the pomegranate reads: "Belonging to the Temple of Lord Jehovah, holy to the priests." </seg>
<seg id=7> However, the inscription has been confirmed to have been carved to it later. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> The ivory pomegranate was bought from an anonymous collector by the Israel Museum for $550,000 in the 1980s. </seg>
<seg id=9> Archaeologist and antique experts believe that it was a treasure inlaid on the top of a scepter by a priest of the First Temple. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Snyder says the ivory pomegranate was identified as authentic by Israeli experts including archaeologist Nahman Avigad before its purchase. </seg>
<seg id=11> Israel's Haaretz reports that Avigad authenticated the antique carelessly only with a magnifying glass. </seg>
<seg id=12> The claim has been rejected by Avigad himself. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=13> Over the past several months, Israeli police has uncovered three large-scale cases of antique forgery successively and summoned hundreds of people for interrogation. </seg>

<seg id=1> Shenzhen to Enforce the Use of "Reclaimed Water" in Some Office Buildings and Residential Quarters </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency report of December 26th from Guangzhou - As a major step in building a "water-saving" city, Shenzhen will enforce the use of "reclaimed water" in some large buildings and residential quarters. At present, relevant design specifications and regulations for the "Reclaimed water" are being drafted. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> "Reclaimed water" refers to municipal and living wastewater which, after being treated, can reach a certain water standard whereby it can be reused to some extent as undrinkable water. </seg>
<seg id=4> Its quality is between that of tap water and drainage water. </seg>
<seg id=5> "Reclaimed water" is generally and extensively used for flushing toilets, gardening and farm irrigation, cleaning roads, car washes, city fountains and supply water for cooling equipment. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> An survey by the Shenzhen Water Board shows that more than 70 buildings had "reclaimed water" collection systems in Shenzhen in the mid-1990s. However, due to technology, design and management problems, all the systems were left unused as a result of the excessively high cost of utilizing "reclaimed water". </seg>
<seg id=7> Only an additional investment of some 300,000 to 400,000 Yuan is needed to install "reclaimed water" processing systems in order to bring these pipelines back to work. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> It is estimated that if all the existing 70 "reclaimed water" systems were put into operation, 35,000 tons of tap water would be saved in Shenzhen each day, based on an average 500 tons of "reclaimed water" to be consumed daily by each residential quarter. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Sources say Shenzhen's "reclaimed water" collection work will begin with the renovation of the more than 70 buildings with the original "reclaimed water" systems. It will be further popularized based on the experience from the test-run. </seg>
<seg id=10> Meanwhile, Shenzhen's water resources authorities will join hands with the urban planning and municipal departments to map out "reclaimed water" design specifications and enforce the use of "reclaimed water" in some large buildings. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency report of December 30th from Moscow (by Staff Reporter Song Shiyi) - The Director of the Russian Presidential Office and Chairman of the Russian Natural Gas Industrial Corporation (Gazprom), Medvedev, told the press on the 30th that Gazprom would merge the Russian Oil Company (Rosneft) as scheduled in January but Yuganskneftegaz, the largest subsidiary company of the Yukos Oil Company purchased by Rosneft, would not be included in Gazprom's assets. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> In another report, when talking about the reason why auctioned assets of Yuganskneftegaz would not be included in the assets of Gazprom, Russian Industry and Energy Minister Khristenko said it was because the nation had already been a majority share-holder of the Russian Oil and Natural Gas Industrial Corporation and the nation didn't want to increase its overwhelming share. </seg>
<seg id=4> He said Yuganskneftegaz's assets would be split off and transferred to a wholly state-owned company. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=5> On the 19th this month, the Russian Federal Asset Foundation held a public auction to sell 76.79% of the shares of Yuganskneftegaz, Yukos Oil Company's largest subsidiary company. The newly formed Baikal Finance Group won the bid with $9.35 billion. </seg>

<seg id=1> (Earthquake and Tsunami) Tsunami Seriously Damages Fishing Industry in India's Tamil Nadu State </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency report of December 31st from Chennai (India) (by staff reporter Jiang Yaping) - Southeastern India's Tamil Nadu State boasts a well developed fishing industry. </seg>
<seg id=3> The state has more than 1,000 kilometers of coastline with annual marine product exports reaching 370,000 tons and earning 23 billion Rupee (1 US dollar equals to 43 Rupees) for the local government. </seg>
<seg id=4> However, the rare tsunami caused by the strong earthquake in the Indian Ocean on the 26th has inflicted unseen heavy losses on the local fishing industry. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> According to authoritative sources from the fishing industry in Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu State, the unexpected disaster has had a great impact on the state's fishing industry. </seg>
<seg id=6> Because there were no warnings or precautions before the disaster, all the fishing boats were anchored in the bay. </seg>
<seg id=7> As a result, more than 7,000 motor vessels and over 30,000 barges in the State have been destroyed to varying degrees, accounting for more than 80% of all boats. In addition, over 30,000 fishing nets have been destroyed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Officials from the Chennai Fishing Industry Association said on the 31st during interview by Xinhua that even if the fishing boats are repaired, fishermen dare not go out to sea in the next few months as they have seen with their own eyes the sea's rampage and ferocity. </seg>
<seg id=9> Some have lost their loved ones and some have suffered economic losses. Their psychological fears will remain for a fairly long time. </seg>
<seg id=10> It is estimated that the State's fishery output in 2005 will decline by 30% as compared with that of 2004. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> During the tsunami on the 26th, most of the coastal fishing villages in Tamil Nadu State were affected, becoming the most seriously hit area in India. </seg>
<seg id=12> By the 30th, the State has recorded a death toll of 6,230, most of them being fishermen. </seg>
<seg id=13> Sources say some 680,000 people were affected by the tsunami with 85% of them engaged in the fishing industry. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=14> At present, the Indian government is actively carrying out rescue operations in an effort to restore the livelihood of local fishermen and fishing production as soon as possible. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency Report of January 11th from Hong Kong (by staff reporter Su Xiao) - The APEC Study Center at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) on 11th expressed its optimism about the world's economic environment this year, with an expected economic growth of 6% in Hong Kong and a 4.4% growth in the first quarter of this year on an annual basis. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Speaking at the "Hong Kong Macroeconomic Forecast" press conference, the Director of the HKU APEC Study Center, Richard Y.C. Wong, said despite an expected rise of the interest rate, Hong Kong's major trading partners' slow economic growth and the economic growth of 3.6% and 8.5% in the US and the Chinese mainland respectively, the global economic environment still holds good prospects for 2005. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> He said the center predicted that Hong Kong's economic growth would remain at approximately 6% while the consumer prices would rise 3% at the end of the year. </seg>
<seg id=5> The reshuffling of the labor market will remain slow and the unemployment rate will drop slightly to approximately 6.3% at the end of the year. </seg>
<seg id=6> The uncertainty resulting from the fluctuation of global oil prices remains the main uncertain factor in Hong Kong's economy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> The Executive Director of the center, Alan K.F. Siu, said the economic growth momentum is expected to be moderate in the first quarter of the year, with the total local output increasing by 4.4%. The slowdown reflects a weakening in external demand, as Hong Kong's major trading partners are growing slower than expected. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> According to the report, Hong Kong's real GDP growth is estimated to be a very robust 8% in 2004, with the average consumer price level declining by only 0.5% and deflation finally contained in the third quarter of last year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Chow Yei-Ching, Chairman of the Steering Committee of the Hong Kong Macroeconomic Forecast said the Hong Kong economy saw a robust growth in 2004, which reflected the sound fundamentals of the local economy. The foreign trade sector was very competitive and was able to capitalize on the strong and fast economic growth last year in the rest of the world and the mainland. The defeat of deflation would enable businesses to enjoy stronger cash flows. </seg>

<seg id=5> The ZEW index dropped sharply to 13.9 in November from 31.3 in the previous month. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=7> BNP economists said: "Considering that major factors driving down economic confidence, including the appreciation of the euro, the uncertainty of global economy and the deteriorating employment rate in the job market in Germany, are all burdens on the future growth expectations for the December survey period, a strong rebound in expectations index will be unlikely." </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Tens of thousands of Yushchenko supporters have congregated in the capital Kiev for two weeks.  They blockaded the government buildings and camped on the main streets specifically designed by Russian experts for military parade.  The power of people they have demonstrated has forced the Supreme Court to annul the second round of the presidential election held on November 21, the Central Election Commission to order a repeat run-off on December 26, and the parliament to approve firing Yanukovych.  However, Kuchma has so far not signed the executive order to remove this successor whom he has nurtured all along. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Yushchenko told the supporting masses that gathered on the capital's Independence Square tonight that Kuchma should dismiss his government and reorganize the Central Election Commission and that both the parliament and Kuchma should agree to amend the electoral law so as to prevent election fraud. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> He said in this speech that kicks off the run-off on December 26: "There should be no talks on removing the blockade of government buildings or the presidential office before these decisions are made. </seg>

<seg id=1> Egypt Announces Breakthrough in Middle East Peace Deadlock </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Egypt said that the Middle East peace agreement is expected to have a new framework. </seg>
<seg id=3> It also said that it may soon dispatch its ambassador again to Israel and restore full diplomatic relations that have been discontinued for four years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Quoting "high-level" Egyptian sources, Egypt's state-run MENA said that all parties seeking a peace plan have come to a consensus on a comprehensive reconciliation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> MENA said: "Egypt, Israel, Palestine and key international parties such as the United States and the European Union have reached an important understanding and agreed in principle to a comprehensive solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Since the Palestinian strongman Arafat passed away last month, the international community has resumed pushing for the policy to restore the Middle East peace in order to bring an early end to years of bloody conflict between Israel and Palestine. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> MENA said officials expect "preparations will continue into July and then be followed by political actions." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> MENA said that afterwards, all parties concerned with the Middle East peace process, Israel, Palestine, Egypt, the United States, Russia and several European countries will hold a meeting in Washington. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> The meeting is expected to cover "a bilateral ceasefire."  The Palestinian Authority shall "put a stop to anti-Israel attacks and strengthen its control over the Gaza Strip and the West Bank." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Regarding this issue, MENA said, Israeli Prime Minister Sharon promised that "as long as the Palestinian Authority respects the ceasefire agreement and takes good control of its territories, Israel will stop military actions against Palestinians." </seg>

<seg id=1> More Than One Billion Children Worldwide Ravaged by War, Poverty and AIDS </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> The UNICEF annual report released today pointed out that more than one billion children, half of the world's total, are brutally ravaged by poverty, war and AIDS. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> UNICEF said the rights of children to a healthy and protected upbringing, as clearly laid out in the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child, were often imperiled, due in part to the failure of governments to implement human rights and economic reforms. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Ms. Bellamy, the UNICEF executive director, pointed out at the annual report launch in London, "When half of the world's children are growing up in hunger and in unhealthy environment, when schools have become targets of attacks and entire villages are destroyed by AIDS, we have failed to deliver our promise to children." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Bellamy added: "Too many governments are making deliberate choices that actually harm children." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> The statistical data jointly compiled by UNICEF and researchers from Britain's London School of Economics and Bristol University revealed a horrific picture of children at risk in most part of the world. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Researchers found that some 640 million children worldwide lack adequate shelters, 400 million have no access to safe drinking water, 270 million have no healthcare, 140 million (mostly girls) have never attended schools. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> More seriously, researchers pointed out, at least 700 million children suffer from all sorts of "severe exploitation," including no access to information and public sanitation facilities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> The tenth annual report released by UNICEF today pointed out that war and AIDS have destroyed all kinds of networks that normally can protect children and that at times children have become direct victims of war and AIDS. </seg>

<seg id=1> EU Resists China's Pressure for Lifting Arms Embargo </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> The European Union rejected today the pressure from China's Premier Wen Jiabao to put a quick end to the arms embargo on China yet said it will work hard toward lifting the 15-year-old ban. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The Netherlands, which holds the European Union's rotating presidency, made the above remark after the EU-China summit. </seg>
<seg id=4> The Netherlands said there should not be any guesses as to how the European Union is going to put an end to the embargo. </seg>
<seg id=5> The European Union imposed the arms embargo on Beijing following the massacre in Tiananmen Square in 1989. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Although the issue of the arms embargo clouded this China-EU summit, both parties still signed some trade and other agreements at the meeting. </seg>
<seg id=7> Both China and the European Union claimed that these agreements have strengthened their mutual "strategic partnership." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> The European Union said in a joint statement issued after its summit meeting with China's Premier Wen Jiabao: "The EU side confirmed its political will to continue to work toward lifting the embargo." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> The statement said the Chinese delegation "welcomed this positive signal and believed this signal will benefit the healthy development of the broad strategic partnership between China and the European Union." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Wen Jiabao made no effort to hide his displeasure in a press conference after the summit and said this embargo "does not reflect the partnership between China and the European Union." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> Wen Jiabao said: "This embargo was a result of the Cold War.  It cannot reflect the current situation, nor can it reflect the partnership between China and the European Union." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> Led by France, some EU countries are working to have this arms embargo lifted, claiming this embargo is already out of date. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=13> Without adding any amendment to strengthen the related EU laws, some wise EU officials are worried that lifting the embargo may open the floodgates to arms sales and help enhance China's military capabilities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=14> Dutch Prime Minister Balkenende said: "I have explained that the European Union has the wish to lift the embargo, but I have also made it clear that lifting the ban is closely connected with making adjustment to the Code of Conduct on arms exports." </seg>

<seg id=1> Preliminary Study Yields Inconclusive Finding that Folic Acid May Lead to Breast Cancer </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> A latest health study pointed out that "folic acid," a B vitamin widely taken by pregnant women to prevent birth defects, may increase the risk of getting breast cancer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> However, researchers said the result of their study may be merely the result of chance because other studies show folic acid can actually reduce the risk of breast cancer.  Therefore, they urged pregnant women to continue taking this supplement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Folic acid, found naturally in dark-color leafy vegetables, is known in the medical community to provide a key aid in the growth of a fetus. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Researchers from the two universities of Bristol and Aberdeen in Britain kept track of 3,000 women who, in the 1960s, either took five milligrams or 0.2 milligrams of folic acid or a placebo mostly during the second and third trimester of their pregnancy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> The report carried in the British Medical Journal said that by September 2002 breast cancer rates for the women who took five milligrams of folic acid turned out to be twice as high as for those who merely took the placebo. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Ness, one of the researchers, stressed that this result was only "preliminary...intended to point toward the way toward further research." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> He said: "It is entirely possible that this is a chance result.  So further scientific studies are required to examine the association if such an association exists before we reach any conclusion." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Ness said women who are planning to become pregnant should still take the supplement of folic acid. </seg>
<seg id=10> He said "there is a considerable difference between the trial dosage" and the current suggested dosage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> According to the British health guidelines, women hoping to become pregnant and those in the first trimester of their pregnancy should take a daily dose of 0.4 milligrams of folic acid, more than 10 times smaller than the dose taken by the women in the study. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> The two opponents confronting each other in Ukraine's presidential re-run on the 26th of this month have now readied themselves for a decisive battle. </seg>
<seg id=3> Pro-Western opposition leader Yushchenko is confident of winning the election, while pro-Moscow incumbent Prime Minister Yanukovych says he will no longer run on behalf of the "shameful" ruling party. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> In the meantime, Russia's President Putin changed his stance toward Ukraine's EU accession, saying he would be happy to see Ukraine join the European Union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Asked what percentage of the vote he is expecting to get in the re-run, Yushchenko said to reporters who packed the conference room: "To be conservative, I should be able to get about 60%." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> On the other hand, Yanukovych, anxiety written all over his face, evaded directly answering reporters' questions several times and finally said simply: "By God's will, we will win." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Yanukovych, originally trained by current President Kuchma as his successor, has now made a departure, positioning himself as a candidate against both the opposition and ruling parties. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> He said, in a manner bordering on name-calling: "I used to trust those cowards and traitors working for the government.  Now I feel nothing but great disappointment.  This government is indeed a shame." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> In an exchange of conditions with the opposition party, Kuchma tried to amend laws in order to transfer some presidential power to the parliament so as to end massive opposition protests and political turmoil that have gone on for two weeks since the November 21 presidential runoff. </seg>
<seg id=10> The original winner Yanukovych has also had his election invalidated by the Supreme Court due to the fraud-riddled voting process and must go through a re-election. </seg>

<seg id=4> The trip may be Powell's last official visit abroad during his term.  The European Union promised him that it will work toward easing tensions between the two sides before US President Bush's visit to Europe next February. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=6> Foreign Minister Bot of the Netherlands, which holds the rotating EU presidency, said: "We must intensify bilateral dialogue during President Bush's second term and rediscover our common ground." </seg>

<p>
<seg id=7> Ms. Waldner, EU External Relations commissioner, said she believed Europe and the United States have made some progress in "putting the difficult moments of the Iraq crisis behind," but she also acknowledged that now is a "key moment in the EU-US relationship." </seg>

<seg id=8> Bush will fly to Brussels on February 22 next year to meet with EU and NATO leaders. </seg>

<seg id=10> On his visit to Europe, Powell stopped in Sofia and Brussels but made only limited progress toward his goal of improving ties. </seg>
<seg id=11> This was especially the case in Brussels, where Powell criticized six anti-war NATO countries for hurting the alliance's "credibility and solidarity" by refusing to participate in training exercises in Iraq. </seg>

<seg id=1> Oliver Stone Wants to Seek Peace with Turkey in Spite of Lingering Dispute over Old Screenplay </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Movie director Oliver Stone, while promoting his new movie "Alexander" in Istanbul, tried to take the chance today to make peace with Turkey. </seg>
<seg id=3> His screenplay for the classic "Midnight Express" was criticized for tarnishing the image of Turkey. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> In a special interview here he told AFP: "It has never occurred to me that this screenplay would be against Turkey.  This screenplay is meant to be against injustice everywhere." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Turkey has been denouncing Stone ever since the premier of this award-winning movie in 1978. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> The movie was based on the memoirs of Billy Hayes. </seg>
<seg id=7> Hayes, a young American, got arrested at Istanbul airport while trying to smuggle hashish from Turkey.  After a protracted lawsuit, he was sentenced to 30 years in jail in Turkey. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Turkish critics accused Stone of taking liberties with Hayes's original work and rewriting it as a racist screenplay in which every Turkish character is, without exception, described as a villain. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> The movie is also filled with horrific prison scenes of rape and torture. </seg>

<seg id=2> Japan's economy may slow down in 2005 as a stronger yen and a growing gap between rich and poor may spoil the harmonious atmosphere the country enjoyed in the first half of this year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> After a decade of stagnation, high corporate profits and strong consumer spending have brought confidence back to Japan this year, but analysts put their hopes of sustaining economic growth on China despite growing political tensions between Japan and China. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> The evidence is growing that Japan's economy could suffer a brief downturn in early 2005, especially if industrial production continues to decline as manufacturers adjust their inventories to avoid a glut. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> According to a new statistic methodology recently adopted, Japan's economy actually shrank slightly in the April-June quarter and grew only 0.1% in the July-September quarter, narrowly escaping a technical recession. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> At present, economists still hold very different opinions on the momentum of economic rebound in Japan. </seg>

<seg id=7> BNP Paribas researchers estimated that the actual economic growth in Japan can reach 2.3% for both the current fiscal year ending in March next year and the following fiscal year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> They called 2005 "the year of recovery" on the grounds that the US economy is on a steady recovery track and Japan's consumer spending is making up for slower exports. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> In another more pessimistic view, UFJ Institute economists projected only 1.8% growth in this fiscal year and even a much slower growth of 0.6% for the following fiscal year. </seg>

<seg id=2> When Thai Premier Thaksin heads into 2005, he is confident of winning a second four-year term.  However, his reputation has already been tarnished because he has failed to quell a bloody separatist insurgency. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> As Thailand's national elections have been scheduled for February 6 next year, Thaksin and his political opponents are actively preparing for the elections.  In the opinion of most analysts, he is expected to win despite this year's serious southern violence and epidemic of bird flu. </seg>

<seg id=4> This year a total of twelve people in Thailand died from bird flu, which swept across much of Asia but was particularly devastating in Thailand. The Thai government frankly admitted it "made a mistake" in its handling of the epidemic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> However, this health concern is unlikely to ruin Thaksin's chance of a second term. On the contrary, many people are asking only how extensive his victory will be, and what will his election victory mean to the Muslim insurgency in the southern provinces. </seg>

<seg id=6> Kraisak, chairman of the parliamentary Senate's Committee on Foreign Affairs, told AFP: "The phenomenon here is that no matter how you look at Thaksin, he has won broad popular support at this moment." </seg>

<seg id=2> In response to insurgents' attack on a dining hall in a US military base in the major city of Mosul in northern Iraq at noon today that killed 22 US and Iraqi soldiers and injured more than 60, the White House Spokesman McClellan said there will be more rampant terrorist activities by Iraqi insurgents as Iraqi elections approach, but these "enemies of freedom" will be surely wiped out. </seg>

<seg id=4> The interview was released earlier by the State Department. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Douglas Paal and TECRO Secretary General John Chen signed a 99-year lease for the new AIT office building site at noon in Taipei's Chun Yue Hotel. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> He said the current office at Hsing Yi Road looks shabby and lacks enough space. </seg>
<seg id=8> For AIT, relocating to the new office building will be a challenge, as it will be able to consolidate offices currently scattered throughout Taipei to operate in a safe and modern facility. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> He said the new building is currently being planned and designed in a way that he hopes will add features to Taiwan's architecture and become a point of pride for Taipei residents. </seg>
<seg id=10> Upon completion of the planning and design, contract bidding will be set for construction, which will begin right after the contractor has made its decision.  It is hoped that groundbreaking will take place within the next few years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> AIT spokeswoman Dana Shell-Smith said the building's cost, including the site lease and architectural design, is estimated at about US$160 million.  Its completion in 2008 depends on many factors, though it is hoped to be done as quickly as possible. </seg>

<seg id=2> Russian President Putin said today that Russia was protecting its national interest by its acquisition of the main asset of Russia's oil giant Yukos, a first move of re-nationalization in the post-Soviet era. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Referring to Rosneft's acquisition of Yuganskneftegaz, a Yukos subsidiary, Putin said at the end-of-year press conference held in the Kremlin: "Russia is now protecting the national interest by using absolute legal market mechanism. </seg>
<seg id=4> And I consider this perfectly normal." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Rosneft today has become the new owner of Yuganskneftegaz after acquiring Baikalfinansgroup which won Yuganskneftegaz earlier at a secretive auction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Earlier last midnight Rosneft announced unexpectedly that it had acquired 100% of shares of the previously unknown Baikalfinansgroup. </seg>
<seg id=7> The acquisition allows Kremlin to have a tight control of Russia's critical energy sector. </seg>
<seg id=8> For nearly 18 months in the past, Russian authorities had been attacking Yukos and its imprisoned billionaire founder Khodorkovsky. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Since Rosneft is merging with Gazprom, combined with Yuganskneftegaz, the consolidated trio will control one fifth of Russia's total oil output and all its natural gas production to become the world's largest energy group. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Putin justified the state's current acquisition by criticizing the under-the-table privatization in the 1990s. </seg>

<seg id=2> Japan's Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) today kicked off the promotion of an advanced Internet program, through which, it hopes, 20% of Japan's workforce can "telecommute" to work from home by 2010 so as to reduce the stress of office work and its consequent toll on families. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> An MIC official said that currently some 4 million Japanese, or 6% of Japan's workforce of 63.2 million, take advantage of science and technology to work from outside office. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Beginning January, six MIC staffers can stay away from office at least one day in a week and work instead from their homes, universities, or libraries through the high speed Internet services. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Based on feedbacks, the MIC will expand the scope of this advanced program until 20% of its 2,500 employees can work from home by 2006. </seg>

<seg id=6> The MIC official said that this program allowing employees to hold meetings through Internet chat rooms and teleconferencing is expected to "improve workplace efficiency." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> He said telecommuting allows employees more time to be with their families and enables breadwinners to assist more in household chores. </seg>
<seg id=8> He said the program can also reduce traffic jam, including vehicle emissions and overcrowding on trolleybuses during peak hours. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> He said the goal of the program is to raise the percentage of Japanese telecommuters to 10% by 2005 and further to 20% by 2010 "by encouraging the sharing of the telecommuting technology with private sector." </seg>

<p>
<seg id=5> In the meantime, the delegation led by US Secretary of State Powell arrived in Thailand last night to show US concern and assess the progress of relief efforts before they head off to a crisis summit to be held in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta on the 6th. </seg>

<seg id=1> Behind Tsunami Catastrophe Relief Efforts Lies Political Jostle </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> As Asian tsunami disaster relief supplies continuously poured into affected areas, a less praiseworthy operation is also secretly underway: Governments are jostling over who should be giving money, who should be receiving aid and who should be leading this relief operation of the largest scale in modern times. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The catastrophe that has killed nearly 150,000 people has rekindled the old fire of war, including the discord among the United States, the United Nations and Europe, and the struggle for leadership in Asia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Relief experts, however, are still hoping with caution that the global nature of this tsunami catastrophe that devastated so many countries might lead to another precedent: Governments that promised to provide aid will actually honor their words. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Juma, professor of international development of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, said: "Promises of aid made by governments have never been carried out 100% and on time." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> With pledged donations from governments hitting US$2 billion, major players in the international political arena including UN Secretary General Annan and US Secretary of State Powell, and leaders from Australia, China and Japan will hold a crisis summit with strong political overtones in Jarkata on the 6th. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> After accusations of a slow response and top UN relief official Egeland's public criticism of rich countries for "being stingy," US President Bush raised US aid nearly tenfold to US$350 million. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> In Asia, the tsunami catastrophe triggered a secretive jostle for regional influence as an increasingly confident China pledged US$60.5 million in aid, an impressive big sum for a developing country. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Japan, which has cut down foreign aid budget for six straight years, also quickly debunked the notion that its national power is declining by vowing to provide at least US$500 million in aid, a sum putting all other nations to shame. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> It was alleged that NHK took out most portions of interviews after its discussion with top political leaders.  Liberal media criticized NHK for what it did since the majority of those interviewed were critics of Japan's wartime conduct and victims of forced sex slavery. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> The trial, held by a women's rights group in Tokyo in December 2000, found late Japanese Emperor Hirohito guilty because he allowed Japanese military to draft women as sex slaves during the Japanese occupation of Asian countries. </seg>

<seg id=1> China Widely Urged to Push for Democracy in the Wake of Zhao Ziyang's Death </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> While the world lavished praise on former CPC leader Zhao Ziyang after his death from illness today, Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, the Taiwan government, and overseas Chinese democracy campaigners all urged Beijing to push for democratic reforms envisioned by Zhao Ziyang. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Ousted in 1989 for his opposition toward the military crackdown on the Tiananmen Square Democratic Movement, Zhao Ziyang spent the rest of his life under house arrest and passed away in a Beijing hospital this morning.  He was 85. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> According to Jiji Press, Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi said in memory of Zhao Ziyang: "I hope they (China) make efforts toward democratization." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Taiwan also urged China to push for democracy and political reforms after the death of Zhao Ziyang. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Overseas Chinese democracy campaigners praised Zhao Ziyang as "one of the greatest reformers in China" who sacrificed his political life in opposing the bloody crackdown on the Tiananmen Square Democratic Movement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Lian Shengde, president of the New York-based Free China Movement and former student movement leader, said: "During the 15 years of his house arrest, he openly advocated the need for political reforms and progress toward rule of law and democracy. </seg>
<seg id=8> Zhao Ziyang will be fondly remembered by later generations as a true democrat and a man of principle." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Some democracy activists are demanding that the Chinese government hold a public funeral for Zhao Ziyang and make a fair evaluation of his contributions. </seg>
<seg id=10> However, they admit the unlikelihood of Zhao Ziyang receiving such treatment because of Chinese government's fears that a public dissatisfied with the CPC ruling will take advantage of the occasion to create unrest. </seg>
<seg id=11> As it was, the 1989 student movement was triggered by the death of reformist leader Hu Yaobang. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> A brief report released by Xinhua News Agency today that Comrade Zhao Ziyang had died of illness in Beijing was the only related official statement. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Wealthy nations around the world have promised to participate in "Millennium Development Goals," an ambitious UN program, to improve the lot of the world's poor and suffering. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Director Brown of the UN Development Program said: "With the right mobilization of resources and political will, and reforms in developing countries as well as in developed countries, these goals are still achievable." </seg>

<p>
<seg id=6> The UN experts said that 22 rich nations worldwide pledged to provide 0.7% of their gross national product in aid to the developing countries, but they have so far only provided 0.25%. </seg>

<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, December 2  Beginning on the 2nd of this month, Hong Kong Observatory will provide two new services for the websites of "World Weather Information Service" and "Severe Weather Information Center" managed by the World Meteorological Organization. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The observatory spokesperson said the two new services are: adding global official weather observation on cloudiness and rain to the WWIS website and adding a recap function to display the tropical cyclone tracks of the past seven days to the SWIC website. </seg>
<seg id=4> These two services represent Hong Kong Observatory's provision of yet another new service after it provided the global heavy rain (including snow) official observation data to the SWIC at the beginning of this year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> It is learned that the WWIS website has been providing official weather forecasts and monthly mean climatological information for major world cities. </seg>
<seg id=6> The new service provides, for the first time, global official weather observations with a global map of cloudiness and rain as a pilot program. </seg>
<seg id=7> The new web page has a wide and intensive coverage of weather observation data and is updated regularly eight times a day. </seg>

<seg id=8> The new product at the SWIC website provides a recap function for the tropical cyclone tracks. </seg>
<seg id=9> In the previous design, the original locations and other information of each tropical cyclone were no longer saved on the website once it had dissipated. </seg>
<seg id=10> However, there are people who would like to obtain relevant information about the tropical cyclone several days after it has made landfall. </seg>
<seg id=11> Therefore, the new product saves the information on the intensities, locations and tracks of all tropical cyclones that have occurred in the past seven days, allowing the public and the media to retrieve the needed information several days after the tropical cyclone has landed and dissipated. </seg>

<seg id=1> World's First Quick Diagnostic Kit for Bird Flu Virus H5N1 Developed in Shantou </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Shantou, December 3 (Zhang Siwen and Lin Junqiang) Reporters learned that the Joint Influenza Research Center, partnering the medical schools of Shantou University and the University of Hong Kong, has developed the world's first quick diagnostic kit for bird flu virus H5N1, following its nearly six months of work with Xiamen University. </seg>
<seg id=3> Using this quick testing method to test a suspected case specimen can produce a conclusion about bird flu infection in as fast as one hour. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> According to an introduction given by Professor Guan Yi, head of the Joint Influenza Research Center of the Shantou University and the University of Hong Kong medical schools, the highly pathogenic and deadly bird flu actually has a much higher mortality rate than the SARS virus, based on current available data. </seg>
<seg id=5> Previously it took at least three to five days, and at times more than one week, to confirm the diagnosis of a "suspected" case of the virus. </seg>
<seg id=6> This successfully developed quick technique for bird flu virus testing uses an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a gold-based dipstick.  Specimens able to be tested include excretions, nasal or throat secretions, whole or split virus cultured in a chicken embryo, and serums.  A conclusion about bird flu infection can be reached in as fast as one hour, and at most within two hours. </seg>
<seg id=7> The new technique is simple, convenient, and fast.  The test can be performed at the site of an outbreak with over 90% accuracy.  It can aid the early detection, diagnosis, quarantine, and treatment of the infectious virus, and thereby prevent widespread outbreak and consequent heavy casualties. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Entrusted by China's Center of Disease Prevention and Control, the Joint Influenza Research Center of the Shantou University and the University of Hong Kong medical schools recently held a training workshop on bird flu virus testing and trained staff from centers of disease prevention and control in 20 provinces and cities throughout the country.  This latest bird flu quick testing technique was included as part of the program. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The spokesperson expressed strong dissatisfaction with the speech delivered on the 2nd in Hong Kong by Hyde, chairman of the US House Committee on International Relations, for his vicious attacks on development and progress in China and his Cold War-style defiling of China's foreign policy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> The spokesperson said it is commonly known that China's development not only serves the basic interests of the 1.3 billion Chinese people, but also supports worldwide prosperity and development. </seg>
<seg id=5> On the international stage, China is a responsible nation and has played an active and constructive role in maintaining world peace and stability. </seg>
<seg id=6> On the issue of nuclear nonproliferation, China has always strictly observed relevant international conventions and firmly opposed nuclear proliferation in any form.

<seg id=7> The spokesperson said that while China-US relations are making healthy and steady progress, it was regretful that Mr. Hyde ignored objective facts and made these extremely irresponsible remarks.  These remarks, totally inconsistent with consensus on the development of bilateral relations reached by Chinese and US presidents recently, run counter to the mainstream voice of the US community for strengthened cooperation with China and are undoubtedly harmful to the development of the China-US relationship. </seg>

<seg id=3> For Zhoushan residents, who have long suffered from water shortage, the seawater that has surged around them for thousands of years will soon be turned into fresh, sweet running water flowing into tens of thousands of households. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Reporters learned from relevant departments that the Hangzhou Water Treatment Technology Development Center under the State Oceanic Administration and Liuheng Township Government of Putuo District, Zhoushan City have recently signed a cooperation agreement on a seawater desalinization project with daily treatment capacity of 10,000 tons. </seg>
<seg id=5> With daily production of 10,000 tons of fresh water, the 50-million-yuan seawater desalinization project would have the mainland's largest treatment capacity so far.  The project's first phase is expected to be completed by next year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Zhoushan is one of the cities in China with serious water shortages. </seg>
<seg id=7> There are 1,390 islands of various sizes within the city.  Fresh water per capita is 601 cubic meters, which is only 25.4% of the average fresh water per capita in Zhejiang Province.  Water supply has always been a problem in the life of this island city's residents. </seg>
<seg id=8> In Putuo District's Liuheng Township for example, 1,500 tons of fresh water have to be shipped daily from a neighboring town at the cost of more than ten yuan per ton. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> The reverse osmosis seawater desalinization technology developed by the Hangzhou Water Treatment Technology Development Center under the State Oceanic Administration is a pressure-driven membrane separation process, currently a hot subject in international seawater desalinization research. </seg>
<seg id=10> The relevant authority at the center said that through technological improvement and by retrofitting domestic-made equipment, both the costs of the reverse osmosis seawater desalinization project and its energy consumption have been reduced. </seg>
<seg id=11> The cost of seawater desalinization treatment has been further reduced from 5 yuan per ton. </seg>

<seg id=1> China Ready to Establish A Sailing Festival </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 8 (Reporter Huang Fuhui) Yao Mingde, chairman of the China Road Transport Association, said at a press conference held here on the 8th that he is "full of confidence" for establishing a China Sailing Festival. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Yao Mingde, who also heads the organizing taskforce office for commemorating the 600th anniversary of Zheng He's Western seas voyage, said that 16 member departments of the organizing taskforce, including the Ministry of Communications, have reached consensus on establishing July 11 of each year, the day Zheng He made his first Western seas voyage, as China's Sailing Festival, and will make a proposal to the State for establishing this festival. </seg>
<seg id=4> Sources said the State Council approval is needed to establish non-holiday festivals. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Zheng He was a world-renowned navigator. </seg>
<seg id=6> During the 28 years from 1405 to 1433, Zheng He led a fleet of more than 200 ships and nearly 30,000 people on a succession of seven long sea voyages, sailing through Southeast Asia, the Indian Ocean to arrive at the Red Sea and Africa.  His journey covered over 300,000 kilometers and included stops in more than 30 countries and regions in Asia and Africa. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> China will host a series of events next year to commemorate the 600th anniversary of Zheng He's Western seas voyages. </seg>
<seg id=8> The logo for the commemorative events was revealed in Beijing on the 8th. </seg>
<seg id=9> The logo comprises a sailboat braving the wind and waves as it sails west, a light blue billowy arching wave, and the text "600th Anniversary of Zheng He's Western Seas Voyage (1405-2005)." </seg>
<seg id=10> It was designed by Yao Ying, an art teacher in a junior high school in Xi'an, Shaanxi Province. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> People from all walks of life have urged that a China Sailing Festival be established in 2005 to coincide with the 600th anniversary of Zheng He's Western seas voyage, and to use the opportunity to educate youngsters, thus enhancing public awareness of sailing and maritime concepts, passing down the spirit of the Chinese nation, and deepening patriotic education. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> Yao Mingde said that China has over 3 million square meters of sea territory and that 90% of China's goods in the international trade is transported by sea. </seg>
<seg id=13> As China is one of the world's large maritime nations, lack of a sailing festival among its various holidays does not make sense. </seg>
<seg id=14> Taiwan Province has already established July 11 as Sailing Festival day. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> On December 11, 1929, Deng Xiaoping, Zhang Yunyi, and others launched and directed the famous Baise Uprising and founded the revolutionary base of Youjiang and the 7th Army of the Chinese Workers and Peasants Red Army. </seg>
<seg id=4> The Baise Uprising, following the Nanchang Uprising, the Autumn Harvest Uprising, and the Guangzhou Uprising, was yet another successful armed uprising led independently by the Communist Party. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> On the morning of December 11, more than 2,000 people holding fresh flowers came to the Baise Uprising Monument to lay their flowers, bow in respect, and reminisce upon the martyrs' great achievements. </seg>

<seg id=1> Experts Propose Establishing a Media Spokesperson System for Chinese Youth </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 13 (Reporter Liu Dan) The "China Youth Social Education Forum 2004: Media and Development of Minors," which concluded in Shanghai on the 13th, proposed that China should establish a media spokesperson system regarding the status of minors, and regularly release information on existing problems and current development of the youth population. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Relevant agencies in Shanghai recently conducted a survey showing that a minor spends an average of 1.17 hours per day doing extracurricular reading, 1.05 hours watching TV, 0.99 hours surfing the Internet, etc.  About half of a minor's free time is spent in a media environment, which, as an entirely new social force, is becoming an indismissible factor in shaping the growth and development of the youth population. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> "Media is a window that links the minds of youth with the outside world.  When the window is open, fresh air comes in along with flies and mosquitoes." </seg>
<seg id=5> Chen Tianqiao, chairman of the board of Shanghai Shanda Networking Development Co., Ltd. said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> While media creates a good condition for the healthy growth of minors, opinions expressed in the media, due to market competition, demand for profits, and the poor nature of some media professionals, tend to mislead youngsters' thoughts and values.  Some media even go further by serving as channels for violence and pornography. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> At present, China has over 2,000 TV channels and more than 1,500 radio frequencies.  There are 1,868 broadcast programs, and nationwide, as many as 87 million netizens. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Relevant authorities at the forum said that establishing a media spokesperson system for minors could provide authoritative survey data on the current status and problems regarding youth development, change the present situation where the media "send wrong messages," and ensure a healthy and beneficial media environment for young people's growth. </seg>

<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, December 17 (Reporter Song Guocheng) Costa, executive director of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), warned in a press release on the 17th that due to increased production of heroin in Afghanistan, the expected price stability and enhanced purity of heroin in the global black market in 2005 will result in more drug-related deaths. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=3> Costa has already sent warnings to health and anti-drug agency officials in Europe and neighboring countries, urging these nations to closely watch new developments in Afghan opium cultivation and international drug crimes, and to take corresponding prevention measures. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> According to statistical data provided by the Vienna-based UNODC, the production of heroin in Afghanistan dropped by 94% when opium cultivation was banned there in 2001.  The following year, the purity of heroin on the European black market declined by 50%. </seg>
<seg id=5> From 2000 to 2002, the number of drug-related deaths in Europe decreased by 20%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Costa said that compared with 2003, the area of opium cultivation in Afghanistan this year has increased by 64%.  The production of heroin reached more than 500 tons, more than the total amount transacted in the global heroin black market in a year.  This trend indicates an increase in the purity of drugs worldwide and a commensurate increase in the number of drug-related deaths. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Costa thinks that the source of drugs in Afghanistan constitutes a "clear and realistic threat" to global anti-drug efforts, and that the increased supply of black market heroin is a "death sentence" for drug abusers. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Domain names form the communication basis of all Internet applications, including electronic commerce and administration, and are currently used extensively as Internet website addresses. </seg>
<seg id=4> When people visit websites and receive and send emails, they first need to input domain names.  Through Domain Name System analysis, domain names are converted to IP addresses, which lead to the web host for information transmission. </seg>
<seg id=5> Domain Name Systems resemble a "nerve system" controlling information transmission on the Internet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> According to an introduction by Mao Wei, director of the CNNIC, which manages China's ccTLD system, the number of netizens in China currently exceeds 90 million, ranking second in the world, and the number of websites in China has topped 650,000. </seg>
<seg id=7> Domain name analysis volume is in direct proportion to use of the Internet.  With the Internet's rapid development, the volume of domain name analysis has also grown rapidly. </seg>
<seg id=8> At present, the number of registered CN domain names has reached 430,000, and is growing by 10,000 each month. </seg>
<seg id=9> The ccTLD server operated and managed by the CNNIC processes 380 million applications for domain name analysis daily at an average rate of more than 4,400 per second and over 8,000 at peak times. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Faced with rapid development of the Internet, the CNNIC, which administers and manages the registration of China's domain names, this year reevaluated China's four original ccTLD nodes and redeployed the CN TLD nodes according to the reevaluation analysis. </seg>
<seg id=11> Based on the level of local Internet development and the quality of connection service provider software and hardware, Shanghai has been chosen as the ccTLD node. </seg>
<seg id=12> Sources said that Shanghai currently hosts 45,000 CN domain names and that 26.6% of its population have Internet access.  Both Internet accessibility and application ranked first in the country. </seg>
<seg id=13> The eastern China region around Shanghai, with a similarly advanced level of development, hosts 130,000 CN domain names and 230,000 websites. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, December 22 (Reporters Yang Yuanyuan and Li Xingwen) In recent years China has seen rapid development in its hard alloy industry, with an annual output exceeding one third of worldwide hard alloy production.  In terms of production scale and capacity, China has become the largest producer of hard alloy in the world.  Offering a full range of selection, China is capable of producing nearly all kinds of hard alloy products. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Reporters learned this information on the 22nd at the China Ganzhou Tungsten Industry Development Strategy Forum currently underway. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Hard alloy, known as "industrial teeth," is used to make cutting tools, high pressure tools, and mining and road construction machinery due to its extreme hardness and wear resistance.  Hard alloy industry development plays an important role in the development of the entire tungsten industry. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Sources said that China's hard alloy industry, beginning from scratch in the 1950s, has grown steadily toward its current status through remarkable achievements. </seg>
<seg id=6> In the early 1980s when the annual worldwide hard alloy output was 25,000 tons, China produced about 5,000 tons of hard alloy per year.  Entering the 21st century, annual global hard alloy output has reached 38,000 tons, while China's hard alloy production has soared to 15,000 tons, exceeding one third of worldwide hard alloy output. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> China has also made significant progress in exporting hard alloy. </seg>
<seg id=8> In 1986, China exported only 100 tons of hard alloy annually.  By 2003, exports had reached 2,500 tons.  This year's exports are expected to exceed 3,000 tons, accounting for one third of hard alloy market transactions worldwide, similar to China's share of total worldwide production.  Foreign exchange earned through hard alloy exports increased from less than US$4 million annually in the past to US$70 million today. </seg>

<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 23 (Reporter Jiang Guocheng) The reporter learned on the 23rd from the China representative office of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) of the bank's recent approval of a US$117.4 million loan to support the construction of a power plant in southern Shanxi Province fired by methane released from coal mining. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The CBM (coal bed methane) Development Demonstration Project will use the latest technology to increase production of CBM and CMM (coal mine methane) to provide fuel for the 120-MW power plant to be constructed. </seg>
<seg id=4> According to the plans, the project will provide at least 166 million cubic meters of CBM annually to about 90,000 residential, industrial, and commercial customers upon its completion in 2008. </seg>
<seg id=5> It will benefit about 410,000 people in the area of Jincheng. </seg>
<seg id=6> Shanxi's coal output accounts for one third of the nation's total. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> The project's total cost is estimated at US$237 million, of which US$20 million will be provided by a loan from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, and US$37.86 million will be provided by a loan from China Construction Bank. </seg>
<seg id=8> The Jincheng Municipal Government and two mining/industrial corporations in the area will provide a total of US$61.24 million in equity capital. </seg>
<seg id=9> The US Trade and Development Agency has also provided a US$500,000 grant for the project. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Methane recovered by drilling into a coal seam from the earth surface after completing construction of a mine well is called CBM, while methane released during underground coal mining operations is called CMM. </seg>
<seg id=11> A highly explosive gas, methane must be removed in advance of coal mining operations to ensure a safe work environment. </seg>
<seg id=12> Removing, collecting, and utilizing methane will reduce greenhouse emissions and help slow global warming and climatic change. </seg>
<seg id=13> The greenhouse effect of methane is 21 times that of carbon dioxide. </seg>
<seg id=14> Replacement of coal with methane can also increase clean fuel usage, improve coal mine efficiency, and improve air cleanness. </seg>
<seg id=15> Hassing, an ADB senior project expert, said the project is expected to account for about 4.5 million tons of carbon dioxide in greenhouse gas emission reduction quotas. </seg>

<seg id=1> (International) Israel Museum's Prized Possession Found to Be a Forgery </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Jerusalem, December 24  James Snyder, director of the Israel Museum, said on the 24th that the museum's prized possession, the ivory pomegranate, has recently been identified as a forgery. </seg>
<seg id=3> This ivory pomegranate was once considered the only artifact ever discovered of the First Temple in Solomon's time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Snyder said in a statement that Israeli authorities conducted a meticulous examination on the thumb-sized ivory pomegranate. </seg>
<seg id=5> Experts found it should be a relic of the Bronze period, dating back much earlier than the time of the First Jewish Temple. </seg>
<seg id=6> A line of Hebrew inscription on the pomegranate read: "Belonging to the Temple of the Lord (Yahweh), holy to the priests." </seg>
<seg id=7> However, the inscription was identified as being later added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> The Israel Museum bought the ivory pomegranate from an anonymous collector for US$550,000 in the 1980s. </seg>
<seg id=9> Archeologists and artifact experts used to believe it was a treasure embedded by the First Temple priest in the top of a scepter and also the only relic left from that period of time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Snyder said that prior to the purchase, the ivory pomegranate was authenticated by the Israeli archaeologist Nahman Avigad and other experts. </seg>
<seg id=11> According to the report by Israel's newspaper Haaretz, Avigad ran a cursory examination of the relic using only a magnifying glass at that time. </seg>
<seg id=12> Avigad himself denied this allegation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=13> In recent months, Israeli police uncovered three large-scale antiquity frauds in succession and questioned hundreds of people. </seg>
<seg id=14> During the investigations, the police and the Antiquities Authority discovered by chance that the ivory pomegranate was a forgery. </seg>
<seg id=15> The police will indict some of the parties involved next week. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=16> In the 10th century B.C., the Jewish King Solomon built the First Temple on today's Temple Mount to store the sacred objects like the Ark of the Covenant and Noah's ark, which were later destroyed. </seg>

<seg id=1> Shenzhen to Mandate Use of "Reclaimed Water" in Some Complexes and Residential Subdistricts </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 26  In a major effort toward building a "water-saving" city, Shenzhen will mandate the use of "reclaimed water" in some comparatively large complexes and residential subdistricts.  Relevant guidelines and regulations on water reclamation design are currently being formulated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> "Reclaimed water" mainly refers to non-drinking water derived from treated urban waste water and domestic sewage, meeting certain water quality standards and reusable within a certain range. </seg>
<seg id=4> Its quality is between that of running water and sewage. </seg>
<seg id=5> In general it is used in large volume for flushing toilets, irrigating gardens and farmland, cleaning roads, washing cars, providing water for city fountains, and as supplementary water for cooling equipment. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> According to an investigation by the Shenzhen Municipal Water Administration, more than 70 complexes in Shenzhen were equipped with "reclaimed water" recycling systems during the mid-1990s, but the construction firms had to abandon their use due to the high costs of recycling and utilizing "reclaimed water" associated with the technology, design, and management. </seg>
<seg id=7> To put these pipelines into actual use, it needs only an additional investment of 300,000 yuan to 400,000 yuan to install a "reclaimed water" treatment system. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Based on daily usage of 500 tons of "reclaimed water" by each residential subdistrict, Shenzhen could save 35,000 tons of running water per day using the 70-plus existing sets of "reclaimed water" pipelines. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Sources said that Shenzhen's "reclaimed water" recycling project will start with the renovation of the 70-plus complexes that were originally equipped with "reclaimed water" recycling systems.  Further promotion will be based on assessment of feedbacks. </seg>
<seg id=10> In the meantime, the Shenzhen Municipal Water Administration will work with city planning and construction departments to develop guidelines as soon as possible for water reclamation design and to mandate the use of "reclaimed water" in some comparatively large complexes. </seg>
<seg id=11> The treated "reclaimed water" will be first used to irrigate urban greenery. </seg>

<seg id=7> By the time they had rushed into the hall of the hotel, the seawater had already flooded the hotel gate. </seg>
<seg id=8> The hotel had three stories but the surging waves flooded right through the second floor.  Nobody had any choice but to stay trapped on the top floor.  Fortunately, the seawater did not continue to rise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Of the 26 tourists, 19 were employees of China United Engineering Corporation. </seg>
<seg id=10> Reporters learned from that company that after the tsunami, the trapped employees called the company for help using their cell phones.  The company immediately requested emergency aid through China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. </seg>
<seg id=11> Upon hearing the news, the Chinese Embassy in Thailand took emergency measures to rush rescue personnel to the site.  Two people were unaccounted for at that time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> It was not until the evening of the 26th that the company was able to contact those two employees, who had followed other tour groups and returned to Phuket Island earlier.

</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> It is also reported that while talking about the reason why the auctioned Yugansk assets will not be incorporated into Gazprom's corporate assets, Russia's Industry and Energy Minister Khristenko said on the same day that it was largely because the State is already the major shareholder of Gazprom and does not want to add more to its controlling shares. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> According to fishing industry authorities in Chennai, capital of Tamil Nadu state, the unexpected disaster had a huge effect on the state's fishing industry. </seg>
<seg id=6> As there was no early warning or caution, fishing boats were all moored in harbors and bays. </seg>
<seg id=7> Consequently, more than 7,000 motor boats and over 30,000 barges, accounting for over 80% of all boats in the state, were damaged in varying degrees.  In addition, over 30,000 fishing nets were destroyed. </seg>
</p>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, January 11 (Reporter Su Xiao) The Center for Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Studies at the University of Hong Kong said on the 11th that with the global economic environment still favorable, Hong Kong's economy is expected to grow about 6% this year, and 4.4% on an annual basis in the first quarter. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Yue-chim Wong, director of the Center for APEC Studies at the University of Hong Kong, said at the "Hong Kong Macroeconomic Forecast" release that although interest rates this year are expected to rise and economic growth of Hong Kong's major trading partners will slow down, with the US and Chinese economies expected to grow 3.6% and 8.5% respectively, the global economic environment in 2005 is still positive. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> He said the Center projects that Hong Kong's economy will maintain growth of about 6% in 2005, while consumer prices will rise 3% by the end of the year. </seg>
<seg id=5> Labor market adjustments will remain slow.  The unemployment rate will adjust slightly to about 6.3% by the end of the year. </seg>
<seg id=6> Uncertainty triggered by fluctuating global oil prices will remain the major factor clouding Hong Kong's economy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Shao Qifa, the Center's deputy director, said that economic growth momentum will slow in the first quarter this year, with total local output growing by 4.4%.  The growth slowdown reflects Hong Kong's weakening external demand caused by further slowdown in economic growth among Hong Kong's major trading partners. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> According to reports, Hong Kong's total output in real terms would record a robust growth of 8% in 2004, as average consumer price levels declined by a mere 0.5%, with deflation disappearing in the third quarter of last year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Zhou Yiqing, chairman of the preparatory committee for Hong Kong University's "Hong Kong Macroeconomic Forecast," said that Hong Kong's strong economic growth in 2004 mainly reflects the stable foundations of the local economy and strong competitiveness in foreign trade markets.  Hong Kong benefited from robust global economic growth and rapid growth in the mainland economy last year, while the end of deflation also allowed business owners to enjoy more cash flow. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 24 (Reporters Zhang Miaomiao and Wang Wentao) The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce, Bureau of Culture and Bureau of Parks issued simultaneously on the 24th seven regulatory safety codes regarding "crowded venues" such as shopping malls and parks. </seg>
<seg id=3> Deputy Mayor Lu Hao of Beijing Municipality believes that the formulation and issuance of these seven regulatory safety codes are the specific embodiment of the standardization of safety requirements in Beijing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> In the seven regulatory safety codes in their trial versions such as "Regulatory Safety Codes for Shopping Malls and Supermarkets in Beijing Municipality (trial version)," "Regulatory Safety Codes for Commercial Performance Venues in Beijing Municipality (trial version)," "Regulatory Safety Codes for Commercial Venues Offering Internet Services in Beijing Municipality (trial version)," and "Regulatory Safety Codes for Parks and Scenic Spots in Beijing Municipality (trial version)," strict numerical standards are all imposed on evacuation passageways and exits.  For example, "Regulatory Safety Codes for Commercial Performance Venues in Beijing Municipality (trial version)" stipulate that the minimum net width of evacuation exits and evacuation passageways in commercial performance venues shall be no less than 1.40 meters. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Liu Xingqi, chief engineer of Beijing Municipal Bureau of Parks, told reporters that the seven "Codes" have made specific stipulations based on a first-ever study on the relationship between the number of customers and the area of business venues such as shopping malls, supermarkets, movie theaters, and parks.  For example, it is stipulated specifically in "Regulatory Safety Codes for Parks and Scenic Spots in Beijing Municipality (trial version)" that park managements shall admit visitors in accordance with the capacity of visitors specified in the "Codes for Park Design." </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> The marriage between Bahraini Princess Meriam Al-Khalifa and Johnson, a US marine, was once widely applauded as a beautiful story by US television stations.  The star-crossed marriage, however, lasted only five years and has now come to an end in the desert casino city of Las Vegas. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Meriam is a member of the Gulf State of Bahrain's royal family.  Johnson risked his military career for this forbidden love.  Their marriage, resembling a fairy tale, was once the theme of a TV drama. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> However, as reported by the Las Vegas Review-Journal, five years have scarcely passed when the two confronted each other in court as Meriam filed with the court for divorce in Las Vegas, where quick marriages but even quicker divorces are granted. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> The pair met in 1999 when Johnson was still a career military man stationed in Bahrain. </seg>
<seg id=6> After he met this little princess who is still in her teens, both fell in love with each other, which changed his life tremendously. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Since their union was forbidden by the royal family, Johnson disguised Meriam in a flannel shirt and a baseball cap and forged her military identification papers, then sneaked her out of her motherland and brought her to the United States. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> After a bitter immigration lawsuit with US authorities, the young couple finally got married at the Candlelight Wedding Chapel on the Las Vegas Strip known for its dazzling grandeur when Johnson was 23 and the bride was only 19. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> However, Johnson said that due to temptations in Las Vegas, otherwise known as a "Sin City," his constant tensions with Meriam's rich and powerful family, and rumors of an assassination plot at his life, this star-crossed marriage eventually failed to survive. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Johnson said he made a living by valet parking for guests of hotels and casinos, while Meriam gradually indulged herself to the nightlife in the gambling city, frequenting nightclubs late at night without any regard to him as a husband. </seg>

<seg id=2> Economists said that the economic indicators to be announced by Eurozone this week would provide further evidence of weak economic confidence and slowing economic output, while British data is expected to show a growth in industrial activities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> They said that economic output data from the largest Eurozone countries will continue to show great volatility every month, but the long-term trend will demonstrate a slow down in economic growth. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=4> This week's key figures will be in Germany. The closely watched economic expectations index, which is expected to be released on the 7th by the ZEW Economic Institute, will provide the first evidence of December's economic confidence in Europe. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> The ZEW index plummeted to 13.9 in November from 31.3 in the previous month. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> In a recent survey, economists indicated that the substantial appreciation of the Euro will continue to affect economic confidence, thus there is no reason to anticipate a rebound in the economic expectations index. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> A BNP economist said, "Given that the main factors negatively affecting economic confidence - the appreciation of the Euro, uncertainty over global growth, and the weak labor market and increasing unemployment in Germany - have remained a drag on future growth expectations over the December survey period, a strong rebound is unlikely." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> According to a survey conducted by AFX News, the AFP financial news subsidiary, economists believed that this index would drop again to 11 in December from 13.9 in the prior month. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> The chaos sparked off by the presidential election in Ukraine has entered its third week. Opposition leader Yushchenko called on his supporters to continue their street protests and their blockade of the presidential palace and government buildings, until outgoing President Kushma fires Prime Minister Yanukovych and his cabinet, and to take actions to ensure justice in the upcoming rerun of the presidential runoff election. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Tens of thousands of Yushchenko's supporters have gathered in the capital city of Kiev for two weeks. They surround government buildings and camp out on major roads designed by Russian specialists for viewing military marches. Their demonstration of the power of the masses has forced the Supreme Court to declare the presidential election on November 21 invalid. The Central Election Commission ordered a new election on December 26 and the Parliament has approved the dismissal of Yanukovych. However, Kushma still has not signed the administrative order to replace the successor, whom he fostered personally. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Yushchenko told the supporters gathered at the Independence Square tonight that Kushma should replace his government and reshuffle the Central Election Commission, and that both the Parliament and Kushma should agree to amend the election law in order to prevent any electoral fraud. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> In his speech that unveiled the runoff on December 26, he stated, "Before these decisions are implemented, we should not discuss lifting the blockade of government buildings and the presidential palace. </seg>
<seg id=6> During these 2 weeks, this square has demonstrated its ardent love for Ukraine, and the civil awareness of tens of millions of Ukrainians who can defend their choices." </seg>

<seg id=4> During the launch of the annual report in London, UNICEF Executive Director Bellamy pointed out, "When half the world's children are growing up hungry and unhealthy, when schools have become targets and whole villages are being emptied by AIDS, we've failed to deliver on the promise of childhood." </seg>

<seg id=5> Bellamy added, "Too many governments are making deliberate choices that actually will hurt childhood." </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> A recent health study suggests that a B vitamin (folic acid) commonly used by pregnant women to prevent birth defects may increase the chance of breast cancer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Nonetheless, researchers stated that their results might be a chance finding, because other research suggests that folic acid will in fact lower the risk of breast cancer. Thus, they advised pregnant women to continue taking this supplement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Folic acid naturally exists in dark green vegetables and it is already known in medical circles that this is an important aid in the development of the fetus. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Researchers from the University of Bristol and the University of Aberdeen in Britain followed 3,000 women who had taken 5 mg or 0.2 mg dose of folic acid or a placebo, mostly during their second and third trimesters of pregnancies in the 1960s. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> This research, published in the British Medical Journal, showed that by September 2002, those who had taken 5 mg doses of folic acid were twice as likely to have breast cancer as those who took only the placebo. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Ness, one of the researchers, stressed that these results present "preliminary findings that are intended to point the way toward further research." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> He stated, "It is entirely possible that this is a chance finding -- so further scientific studies are required to examine the association, if there is one, before we reach any conclusions." </seg>

<seg id=11> According to the UK's health standards, women planning to become pregnant and those who are in their first trimester of pregnancies should have 0.4 mg of folic acid everyday, which is more than 10 times lower than the dosage taken by the women in the above study. </seg>

<seg id=2> U.S. Secretary of State Powell held a meeting with EU senior officials today for a last attempt at bringing cohesion between the United States and the EU before his leaving office. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Movie director Oliver Stone is trying to use the opportunity of promoting his new movie "Alexander" in Istanbul to make peace with Turkey. </seg>
<seg id=3> His screenplay for the classic "Midnight Express" has been criticized as tarnishing the image of Turkey. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> He told AFP in an interview here, "I never intended the screenplay to be against Turkey. It was against injustice everywhere." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Turks have condemned Stone since the first screening of this award-winning movie in 1978. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> This movie was adapted from the memoirs of Billy Hayes. </seg>
<seg id=7> Hayes, an American youth who was caught at the Istanbul airport for attempting to smuggle hashish out of the country, was sentenced to 30 years in a Turkish prison following a protracted legal battle. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Turkish critics accused Stone of taking liberties with rewriting Hayes' original work into a racist screenplay. All the Turkish characters in the movie are depicted as villains without exception. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> The movie is also full of horrific prison scenes of rape and torture. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Stone admitted, "Perhaps some of the zealousness, some of the anger came from being young and trying to make the point too much, too hard." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> However, he added, "It was true that Billy Hayes did get sodomized in the Turkish prison. He was convicted to a 30-year prison term for an offense not worth mentioning, and he was also treated brutally in prison. So this is all based on the facts." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> Stone said, "The bigger picture is that Turkey is not the only country whose prison system is not properly working. America has similar problems." </seg>

<seg id=1> Japanese Economic Growth May Slow Down Next Year </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> The Japanese economy may slow down in 2005 as a stronger yen and a widening gap between the rich and the poor may destroy the harmonic atmosphere the country enjoyed in the first half of the year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> With huge corporate profits and strong consumer spending, Japan has regained its confidence after 10 years of stagnation, but analysts rest their hopes for sustaining the economic growth on China despite the rising political tensions between the two countries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Evidence has gradually shown that the Japanese economy may suffer a temporary setback in early 2005, especially if industrial production continues to fall while manufacturers adjust stock inventories to avoid overstock. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> According to the newly adopted statistical methodology, the Japanese economy actually contracted slightly in the April-June quarter while it grew by just 0.1 percent in the July-September quarter, narrowly escaping a technical recession. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=6> At present, economists are still greatly divided over the robustness of the Japanese economy. </seg>

<seg id=7> BNP Paribas researchers anticipated a 2.3 percent growth in real terms in the current fiscal year that ends in March of next year and the next fiscal year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> They called 2005 the "Year of Recovery" based on the reasons that the US economy has remained stable on the recovery track and Japanese consumer spending is picking up the slack for slower exports. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> A more pessimistic note is that UFJ Institute economists predicted a mere 1.8 percent economic growth in this fiscal year and a lower 0.6 percent in the following year. </seg>

<seg id=3> A Thai national election is scheduled to be held on February 6, 2005. Thaksin and his political rivals are actively preparing for the election. Most analysts expected him to win despite the serious violent clashes and the bird flu in the South. </seg>

<seg id=1> Putin Declares Purchase of Yuko's Major Asset Is To Protect State Interests </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Russian President Putin stated today that the state's purchase of Russian oil giant Yuko's major asset was to protect the interests of the state. It is also the first re-nationalization action taken in the post-Soviet era. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> When discussing the state-run petroleum company Rosneft's purchase of Yuko's subsidiary company, Yuganskneftegaz, at the end-of-the-year press conference in the Kremlin, Putin stated, "Today the state, using absolutely legal market mechanisms, is protecting its interests. </seg>
<seg id=4> I consider this absolutely normal." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Rosneft became the new owner of Yuganskneftegaz after acquiring Baikal Finance Group, the company that won the bid for Yuganskneftegaz at an earlier secret auction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Rosneft issued an unexpected announcement a little before midnight last night - that it has acquired 100 percent of the shares of the previously unknown Baikal Finance Group. </seg>
<seg id=7> This acquisition gives the Kremlin solid control over the energy industry, which is vital to Russia. </seg>
<seg id=8> In the past 18 months, Russia has repeatedly attacked Yuko and its billionaire founder, Khodorkorsky, who is presently in prison. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Rosneft is merging with state-run Gazprom. With the addition of Yuganskneftegaz, the three together will control one fifth of the total oil production in Russia and all its natural gas production, thus becoming the world's largest energy group. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Putin defends the state-purchase actions by criticizing murky privatizations in the 1990s. </seg>
<seg id=11> The privatization policy at that time had allowed Russia's most valuable economic asset to fall into the hands of slick businessmen like Khodorkorsky. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> The Japanese Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications launched an advanced Internet program today, in the hopes that by 2010, 20 percent of the Japanese workforce can "telecommute" from home through this program in order to reduce stress from office life and disruptive family problems. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> An official from the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications stated that currently, approximately 4 million Japanese, representing 6 percent of the total workforce of 63.2 million people, utilize technology to work outside the office. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Starting in January, six Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications employees will be working outside the office, either from home, from universities, or from libraries through high-speed Internet service at least once a week. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications will then expand the scope of this advanced program based on feedback, until 20 percent of its 2500 employees can work from home by 2006. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications official said that this program, which allows employees to hold meetings through Internet chat rooms and teleconferencing, will hopefully "improve the efficiency of work places." </seg>

<p>
<seg id=7> He said that telecommuting would allow employees to spend more time with their families, so that breadwinners can also help out with more chores. </seg>
<seg id=8> He stated that this program could also reduce traffic congestion, including car exhaust and the overcrowding of trains during rush hour. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> He claimed that the goal of this program is, "through the encouragement of sharing telecommuting technologies with the private sector," to increase the ratio of Japanese telecommuters to 10 percent by 2005 and then to 20 percent by 2010. </seg>

<seg id=4> This research was conducted by a group of Russian scientists headed by epidemiologist Zykov. </seg>

<seg id=7> The Altai Republic is located in the mountainous region on the southern border of Siberia. </seg>

<seg id=2> According to rumors, NHK toned down a program about women who were forced by the Japanese army to become prostitutes during the Second World War that aired a few years ago, due to pressure from political figures. Japanese liberal media thus launched a dispute with their conservative colleagues on the issue. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> According to sources, NHK cut the majority of the interview contents in the program after discussing it with top politicians. Most of the interviewees were critics of Japanese wartime behavior and victims who were forced to become prostitutes. NHK's action had solicited criticism from the liberal media. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=4> Nonetheless, conservative newspapers defended NHK's decision to revise the contents of the program, stating that the company's senior officials had the responsibility to ensure the fairness and objectivity of the program's contents. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> The trial was held by a Japanese women's rights group in December 2000. The verdict found late Emperor Hirohito guilty of allowing the Japanese army to commandeer prostitutes during the Japanese occupation of Asian countries. </seg>

The achievement thus enabled Shanghai to leap to lead the world in both output and production capacity of power plant equipment and fulfilled the wish of several generations of the Chinese equipment manufacturing industry. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Shanghai Electric Group is the largest power plant equipment-manufacturing base in China. </seg>
<seg id=4> With the rapid growth in the demand for power-generating equipment in China in recent years, power generator manufacturers across the country have entered a phase marked by huge growth and major development. </seg>
<seg id=5> Shanghai Electric Group consolidated the favorable resources of power plant equipment including steam turbines and power plant boilers. After undertaking the production of four million-kilowatt grade thermo-power generating units, it has also acquired production orders for nine heavy-duty fuel-powered electric generating units and three waste heat boilers through a combined bidding. </seg>
<seg id=6> Meanwhile, through an integrated operation, it has further enhanced its business management, technology development, and production efficiency. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> At present, Shanghai Electric Group holds 40 percent of the market share for the Chinese power plant equipment industry and is continuously expanding its overseas markets in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and South America. </seg>
<seg id=8> This year alone, Shanghai Turbine Generator Co., Ltd has received a RMB 6 billion yuan sales order for the main engine components of the power generating equipment. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Zheng Jianhua, president of Shanghai Electric Group, said that the "power shortage" this summer had boosted the demand for power plant equipment across the country. The competition in the power plant equipment manufacturing market is gradually becoming white-hot. </seg>
<seg id=10> The group is putting into practice its three objectives of "developing and producing million-kilowatt grade thermo-power generation, gas turbine generating units, and million-kilowatt grade nuclear power" in order to achieve its goal of rising to the world's 500 strongest as soon as possible. </seg>

<seg id=1> (Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan) Hong Kong Observatory to Provide New Services for WMO </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, December 12 - The Hong Kong Observatory will launch two new services for the "World Weather Information Service" and "Severe Weather Information Center" websites hosted by the World Meteorological Organization, starting December 2. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> A spokesman for the observatory said that the two new services are to add a global official weather observation of cloudiness and rain to the "World Weather Information Service" website and a recap function to display the tropical cyclone paths for the past seven days on the "Severe Weather Information Center" website. </seg>
<seg id=4> These two programs are another new service that the Hong Kong Observatory is offering after it started providing the "Severe Weather Information Center" with official observation information of heavy rain (including snow) in areas around the world earlier this year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> According to information, the "World Weather Information Service" website has been providing official weather forecasts and monthly mean climatological information for the world's major cities. </seg>
<seg id=6> The new service, for the first time, provides global official weather observations with the cloudiness and rain distribution map as its first project introduced. </seg>
<seg id=7> The weather observation information on the new web page has a wide coverage and a high density, with eight scheduled updates per day. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> The new product of the "Severe Weather Information Center" website is to provide a recap function for displaying tropical cyclone paths. </seg>
<seg id=9> The previous design was that once the tropical cyclone dissipated, information including the location of the tropical cyclone would no longer be saved on the website. </seg>
<seg id=10> However, the public often still wants to obtain related information about the tropical cyclone a few days after it makes landfall. </seg>
<seg id=11> As a result, the new product will store information on the intensities, locations, and paths of tropical cyclones that have happened in the past seven days so the public and the media can still obtain desired information several days after the tropical cyclone has landed and dissipated. </seg>

<seg id=1> World's First Bird Flu Virus H5N1 Strain Rapid Diagnostic Kit Successfully Developed in Shantou </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Shantou, December 3 (Reporters Zhang Yiwen, Lin Juniang) - Reporters obtained information from Shantou University Medical College/The University of Hong Kong Faculty of Medicine Joint Influenza Research Center that after almost six months of collaboration with Xiamen University, they have developed the world's first rapid diagnostic kit for the bird flu virus H5N1 strain. </seg>
<seg id=3> A confirmation of whether a person has contracted the bird flu virus can be obtained in as little as an hour by testing a specimen from the suspected carrier with this rapid diagnostic method. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> According to Professor Guan Yi, director of Shantou University/The University of Hong Kong Faculty of Medicine Joint Influenza Research Center, based on the information available now, bird flu, which is listed as a highly fatal pathogenic virus, has a case fatality rate much higher than the SARS virus. </seg>
<seg id=5> In the past, it would take three to five days or even more than a week to confirm a "suspected" case of virus infection. </seg>
<seg id=6> The successfully developed bird flu rapid diagnostic technique uses Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Colloidal gold immunochromatographic assay techniques. Testable specimens include excrement, nasal or throat secretions, intact virus cultivated from chicken embryo, virus isolate, or serum. A confirmation of bird flu virus infection can be reached in as soon as an hour or within two hours at the latest. </seg>
<seg id=7> The new technique has the characteristics of being simple, convenient, and fast. Testing can be conducted at the outbreak site with an accuracy rate of over 90 percent. It can help the early discovery, diagnosis, quarantine, and treatment of the infectious disease to prevent a widespread and major disaster. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Commissioned by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shantou University Medical College/The University of Hong Kong Faculty of Medicine Joint Influenza Research Center recently held a training workshop on bird flu testing techniques to train students from disease control and prevention centers in 20 provinces and cities across the country. The newest bird flu virus rapid detection technique was also included in the course content. </seg>

<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, December 3 - A spokesman for the Office of the Commissioner of Foreign Affairs in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region released a statement on the 3rd strongly denouncing the speech made yesterday by Hyde, Chairman of the U.S. House International Relations Committee, in Hong Kong. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The spokesman claimed that China had expressed its strong displeasure with the speech delivered by Mr. Hyde, Chairman of the U.S. House International Relations Committee, in Hong Kong on December 2, which contained malicious attacks on China's development and progress, and tarnished China's foreign policy with his Cold War mentality. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> The spokesman stated that people in the world know that not only is China's development in line with the basic interests of 1.3 billion Chinese, it is also beneficial to the world's prosperity and advancement. </seg>
<seg id=5> In the international political arena, China is a responsible country that has contributed positively and constructively to uphold world peace and stability. </seg>
<seg id=6> On the issue of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, China has strictly enforced the international agreements and is opposed to any form of nuclear proliferation, and is advocating resolving these problems through negotiations, talks, and enhanced international monitoring. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> The spokesman stated that it was regretful that Mr. Hyde ignored the objective facts and issued such irresponsible statements at a time when the Sino-US relationship is heading towards healthy and stable progress. His statements contradicted the recent consensus in developing bilateral ties, reached by the state leaders of China and the U.S. They are running counter to the demand of mainstream U.S. society for enhancing the cooperative relationship with China, and will certainly harm the development of the Sino-US relationship. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, December 6 (Pan Yifeng, Xu Qun) - The largest seawater desalination project ever in China, with a daily treatment capacity of 10,000 tons, will begin in Putuo District, Zhoushan City of Zhejiang Province. </seg>
<seg id=3> For Zhoushan residents, who suffer greatly from water shortages, the vast and mighty seawater that has been flowing by their side for hundreds and thousands of years will soon become clear and sweet tap water that runs into tens of thousands of households. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Information gathered by reporters from relevant departments showed that Hangzhou Development Center of Water Treatment Technology under the State Oceanic Administration and Liuheng Township government in Putuo District of Zhoushan City signed the cooperation agreement for a 10,000-ton seawater desalination project a few days ago. </seg>
<seg id=5> The investment for the project is RMB 50 million yuan with a daily fresh water production capacity of 10,000 tons. Its treatment scale is the largest among all seawater desalination projects in China thus far. The first stage of the project is expected to be completed next year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Zhoushan City is one of the Chinese cities that suffers the most from water shortages. </seg>
<seg id=7> There are 1,390 islands of varying sizes in the city. On average, each person has 601 cubic meters of fresh water, only 25.4 percent of that of Zhejiang Province. Drinking water has always been a problem that affects the residents' lives in this island city. </seg>
<seg id=8> For instance, Liuheng Town in Putuo District has to transport 1,500 tons of fresh water from a nearby town every day at a cost of more than RMB 10 yuan per ton. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> The reverse osmosis seawater desalination technology developed by Hangzhou Development Center of Water Treatment Technology under the State Oceanic Administration is a membrane diffusion process powered by pressure and is the focus in today's international seawater desalination research domain. </seg>
<seg id=10> The relevant leading official of the center said that through the technological enhancement and improvement of equipment inside China, the cost for the reverse osmosis seawater desalination project and its energy consumption have both been lowered. </seg>
<seg id=11> The cost for each ton of seawater desalination treatment will be further reduced from the existing RMB 5 yuan. </seg>
<seg id=12> It indicates that the cost for seawater desalination will hopefully approach the price of tap water and industrial use water. </seg>

<seg id=1> Three Gorges Dam Underground Power Station Construction Begins Soon </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 8 (Reporter Shi Yongfeng) - December 8. An invitation for a public bid for the principal construction of the underground power station of the Three Gorges Dam is underway for the first time, thus marking the inauguration of the construction project. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The Three Gorges Dam Project plans to install twenty-six 700,000-kilowatt hydro turbine-generating units with an installed capacity of 18.2 million kilowatts. The average annual power generated after the entire unit goes into operation will be 84.7 billion kilowatt-hours. </seg>
<seg id=4> In order to further develop the power generating potential of the Three Gorges Dam Project, a space for the construction of an underground power station was reserved in advance in its initial design. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> According to a top official of the Yangtze River Three Gorges Project Development Corp., the underground power station of the Three Gorges Dam is located inside the mountains, to the right side of the great dam. Its main structures include an intake tower, diversion canal, main powerhouse, tailwater system, vertical shafts, and a 500-kilovolt transformer substation. </seg>
<seg id=6> Six 700,000kw-generator units will be installed in the underground power station. </seg>
<seg id=7> In this case, the total number of generators installed in the Three Gorges Dam Project will be increased from the original 26 to 32 units while the installed capacity will be increased from 18.2 million kilowatts to 22.4 million kilowatts, thus greatly improving the power generating capacity of the Three Gorges Dam Project. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Flood control is the priority mission for the Three Gorges Dam Project. </seg>
<seg id=9> According to the Three Gorges reservoir operation adjustment plan, every year before the flood season, the water retention level inside the Three Gorges reservoir will be operated at the lowered flood control limit level of 145 meters, from its normal 175 meters level. </seg>
<seg id=10> Thus, the construction of the underground power station will increase the water utilization index of the Three Gorges reservoir, reduce water wastage and increase power-generating capacity in order to maximize the impounding stream peak adjustment period of the power station. </seg>
<seg id=11> Currently, early construction projects of the Three Gorges Dam underground power station, including the digging of branch tunnels and tailwater ditches, as well as the construction of the prop-ups, have begun. </seg>
<seg id=12> According to sources, the underground power station will be completed and go into operation by the end of 2008. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> On December 11, 1929, Deng Xiaoping and Zhang Yunyi led and staged the famous Baise Uprising, and established the Youjiang Revolutionary Base and the Seventh Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. </seg>
<seg id=4> The Baise Uprising was yet another successful armed uprising independently led by the Communist Party following the Nanchang Uprising, Autumn Harvest Uprising, and Guangzhou Uprising. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> On the morning of December 11, more than 2,000 people came to Baise Memorial with flowers to present their bouquets, and to bow to reminisce about the monumental contributions of the martyrs. </seg>
<seg id=6> Afterwards, they watched the movie Baise Uprising and participated in activities, including the photo display of Zhang Yunyi in Guangxi. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Huang Qunsheng, a student of Baise High School, said, "Despite the educational contents on patriotism and collectivism in our daily history and ideological and political courses, after our on-site visit today, I feel that this is a lively educational lesson in patriotism." </seg>

<seg id=1> Experts Suggest Establishment of News Spokesman System for Minors in China </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 13 (Reporter Liu Dan) - The "Forum on Social Education for Chinese Youth 2004 - The Media and the Development of Minors" that closed on the 13th in Shanghai suggested that China should establish a news spokesman system related to the situation of minors to release regular information on the current developmental situation of minors and the issues encountered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> A recent survey conducted by relevant Shanghai authorities showed that minors spend an average of 1.17 hours per day reading leisure books, 1.05 hours watching television, 0.99 hours surfing the Internet...About half of the arrangements for minors' after-school time involve the media. The media has become a factor affecting the growth and development of minors with an entirely new social force that cannot be ignored. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> "The media is a window that connects the souls of minors with the outside world. Once the window is opened, while fresh air comes in, flies and mosquitoes will also enter," </seg>
<seg id=5> Chen Tianqiao, President of Shanghai Chengda Network Development Company, Ltd. said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> At the same time, the media is creating good conditions for the healthy growth of minors, due to market competition and the need for economic benefits, as well as the low quality of some news professionals; the viewpoints in scripts may easily mislead the thinking and value systems of the youth, while some media even disseminate violent and pornographic content. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> There are currently more than 2,000 television channels and over 1,500 radio frequencies that run 1,868 broadcast programs, and the number of Internet users in China has reached 87 million people. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Relevant officials of the forum stated that the establishment of a news spokesman system for minors can supply authoritative study materials for the current situation and issues encountered in youth development, so that the media "nonsense talk" situation can be corrected and a beneficial public opinion environment for the growth of minors can be provided. </seg>

<seg id=1> (International) UN Warns of Rise of Global Drug-Related Deaths in 2005 </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, December 17 (Reporter Song Guocheng) - Costa, Executive Director of the United Nations Office on Drug and Crime, warned in a press release on the 17th that because of the increase in heroin production in Afghanistan, it is expected that the global price of heroin on the black market is going to stabilize and the pureness will increase, thus resulting in the deaths of more drug addicts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Costa has already issued warnings to officials of health and anti-drug agencies in Europe and its surrounding countries and called on these countries to pay close attention to the newest trends in Afghanistan drug cultivation and international drug-related crimes and to adopt relevant measures. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> According to the statistics numbers provided by the United Nations Office on Drug and Crime, headquartered in Vienna, when the opium cultivation industry in Afghanistan was banned in 2001, heroin production in Afghanistan dropped by 94 percent and the pureness of black market heroin in Europe decreased by 50 percent the following year. </seg>
<seg id=5> In 2000 and 2002, the number of drug related deaths in Europe dropped by 20 percent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Costa said that the area for heroin cultivation in Afghanistan increased by 64 percent this year, compared to 2003. Heroin production has reached more than 500 tons, higher than the annual transaction amount on the world heroin black market. This trend indicates that the global pureness of the drug will be higher and there will be a corresponding increase in drug-related deaths. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Costa believed that Afghanistan as a drug source poses a "clear and present danger" to global anti-drug efforts. The increase in the supply of black market heroin implies a "death sentence" for drug addicts. </seg>

<seg id=3> This was the second Guantanamo prisoner determined by the U.S. army not to be an enemy combatant. </seg>
<seg id=4> England said that the Pentagon confirmed this prisoner's status a day or two ago. The State Department would notify the prisoner's home country and arrange for his release. </seg>
<seg id=5> Nevertheless, he did not reveal the name and nationality of the prisoner and did not explain under what conditions he was captured. </seg>
<seg id=6> England refused to admit that the Department of Defense had made a mistake in determining the identity of the Guantanamo prisoner. </seg>
<seg id=7> He stated that the army investigative panel in charge of reviewing the status of the Guantanamo prisoners had conducted reviews of 507 prisoners and determined the identities of 230 people; the enemy-combatant status of 228 pf these people was correct. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 21 (Reporters Feng Yizhen, Chen Haiyu) - December 21. The China Internet Network Information Center and the Shanghai Information Industry Group signed a contract on locating the state domain name top-level node in Shanghai. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> A domain name is the communication basis for all Internet applications including the conducting of electronic business and electronic government affairs. At present, it is widely used for Internet addresses. </seg>
<seg id=4> Users have to enter the domain name before visiting websites or receiving electronic mail. Through the decoding service of the domain name system, the domain name will be converted into an IP address and find the host computer of the website to enable the information transfer. </seg>
<seg id=5> Just like the "nervous system," a domain name system controls information transmission on the Internet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Mao Wei, Director of China Internet Network Information Center, which manages China's state top-level domain name system, explained that to date, China has the second highest number of Internet users in the world with over 90 million people. The number of websites has topped 650,000. </seg>
<seg id=7> The decoding capacity of the domain name is in direct proportion to the usage of the Internet. With the rapid expansion of the Internet, the decoding capacity of the domain name is also developing at top speed. </seg>
<seg id=8> Currently, the registration volume of the domain name "CN" is increasing at a rate of 10,000 per month and has reached 430,000. </seg>
<seg id=9> The state top-level domain name server hosted and managed by the China Internet Network Information Center handles over 380 million domain name decoding requests per day at an average rate of over 4,400 times per second, with a peak value of more than 8,000 times. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Confronted with the rapid development trend of the Internet, the China Internet Network Information Center, which manages domain name registration in China, conducted a reevaluation of the four original state domain name top-level nodes this year and made rearrangements for the "CN" domain name top-level nodes according to the evaluation results. </seg>
<seg id=11> The center decided to situate the state domain name top-level node in Shanghai, based on the local Internet development level and the qualifications of the accessing unit. </seg>
<seg id=12> According to sources, at present, there are 45,000 "CN" domain names in Shanghai, an Internet user popularity rate of 26.6 percent. Its Internet popularity rate and usage level are both the highest in the country. </seg>
<seg id=13> Regions in Eastern China neighboring Shanghai have 130,000 "CN" domain names and 230,000 websites. Their development levels are also among the highest of the country. </seg>

<seg id=1> China Becomes World's Largest Hard Alloy Production Country </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, December 22 (Reporters Yang Yuanyuan, Li Xingwen) - China's hard alloy industry has developed rapidly in recent years. Its annual output is more than one third of the world's total hard alloy output. From the production scale and output standpoint, China has become the world's largest hard alloy production country, with a whole array of alloy varieties and the ability to produce most of the products. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The information above was gathered by the reporters on the 22nd, at the China Ganzhou Tungsten Industry Development Strategy Symposium that is in progress. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Hard alloy is known as "industrial tooth." It is used as cutting tools, high-pressure tools, and machineries for mining and road construction because of its extremely high hardness and wear-proof capability. The development of the hard alloy industry plays an important role in the entire growth of the tungsten industry. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> According to information, China's alloy industry started in the 1950s of the 20th century, from the ground up. Through continuous development, it has made outstanding achievements so far. </seg>
<seg id=6> In the early 1980s of the 20th century, when the world annual hard alloy output was at 25,000 tons, the annual hard alloy output of China was approximately 5,000 tons. Entering the 21st century, the world annual hard alloy output has reached 38,000 tons while China's output has increased rapidly to 15,000 tons, constituting more than one-third of world's hard alloy production. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> China's hard alloy export has also achieved significant improvements. </seg>
<seg id=8> In 1986, China's alloy export volume was only 100 tons; while in 2003, the export volume reached 2,500 tons. It is expected that this year's export volume will be more than 3,000 tons, accounting for one third of the world's hard alloy market circulation capacity as in its output. The annual net profits of hard alloy have increased from less than U.S. $4 million in the past to U.S. $70 million nowadays. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 23 (Reporter Jiang Guocheng) - The reporter gathered information from the Asian Development Bank's China Office on the 23rd that the bank has recently approved a US $117.4 million loan to support the construction of a power plant in southern Shanxi Province, powered by methane produced during mining. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The Coal Bed Gas Development Demonstration Project will utilize the newest technology to increase the output of coal bed gas and coalfield gas to supply the fuel for a soon-to-be constructed 120,000-kilowatt power plant. </seg>
<seg id=4> According to the project plan, when the project is completed in 2008, it will supply approximately 90,000 residential, industrial, and commercial users with at least 166 million m3 of coal bed gas per year. </seg>
<seg id=5> The project will benefit about 410,000 people in the Jincheng area. </seg>
<seg id=6> The total coal output of Shanxi constitutes about one third of the total national output. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> The project is estimated to cost U.S. $237 million. The Japan Bank for International Cooperation will provide U.S. $20 million, while China Construction Bank will provide U.S. $37.86 million. </seg>
<seg id=8> The Jincheng municipal government and two local mining/industrial groups will provide a total of U.S. $61.24 million of capital. </seg>
<seg id=9> The U.S. Trade and Development Agency also awarded a grant of U.S. $500,000 to the project. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Through in-mine drilling from the ground surface, the methane obtained from the mineshaft after it is built is called coal bed gas, while that produced during underground mining is called coalfield gas. </seg>
<seg id=11> Methane is a highly explosive gas and has to be released in advance during the mining process in order to guarantee the safety of the work environment. </seg>
<seg id=12> The elimination, collection, and utilization of methane will lower the release of greenhouse gas and is useful in slowing down global warming and climate change. </seg>
<seg id=13> The greenhouse effect of methane is 21 times that of carbon dioxide. </seg>
<seg id=14> The substitution of coal with methane will increase the consumption of clean fuel, improve coalmine efficiency, and make the air cleaner. </seg>
<seg id=15> Hassing, Senior Officer of the Asian Development Bank stated that the project will hopefully provide approximately 4.5 million tons of emissions reductions of carbon dioxide greenhouse gas. </seg>

<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Jerusalem, December 24 - James Snyder, Director of the Israel Museum, stated on the 24th that the museum's most precious exhibit, the Ivory Pomegranate, was confirmed as a fake a few days ago. </seg>
<seg id=3> The Ivory Pomegranate was once believed to be the only artifact discovered from the First Temple, during King Solomon's era. </seg>

<seg id=4> Snyder stated in a declaration that the Israeli authorities had conducted a detailed examination on the thumb-sized Ivory Pomegranate. </seg>
<seg id=5> Experts discovered that the relic should belong to the Bronze Age and is considerably older than the First Jewish Temple's era. </seg>
<seg id=6> A line inscribed in Hebrew lettering on the Ivory Pomegranate reads, "Belonging to the Temple of the Lord (Yahweh), holy to the priests." </seg>
<seg id=7> The inscription was verified to be added afterwards. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> The Israel Museum spent U.S. $550,000 to buy this Ivory Pomegranate from an anonymous collector in the 1980s of last century. </seg>
<seg id=9> Archaeologists and antiquity experts once believed that it was a treasure mounted on the top of a priest's scepter in the First Temple, and the only relic left from that time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Snyder claimed that before they bought the Ivory Pomegranate, Israeli archaeologist Nahman Avigad and other experts had authenticated the relic. </seg>
<seg id=11> According to Haaretz Daily, Avigad only used a magnifying glass to do a cursory check on the relic at that time. </seg>
<seg id=12> Avigad personally denied such allegations. </seg>

<seg id=13> In recent months, Israeli police have discovered three major antiquity forgery cases successively and have subpoenaed several hundred people. </seg>

<seg id=1> Shenzhen Enforces "Middle-Water" Usage in Buildings and Small Districts </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 26 - Shenzhen will enforce "middle- water" usage in some larger-scale buildings and small districts as a major measure in establishing "water-saving style" cities. At present, relevant specifications and regulations for the middle-water plan are being drawn up. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Middle-water mainly refers to non-drinking water from treated city and daily wastewater that has reached a certain water quality, and can be reused in certain areas. </seg>
<seg id=4> Its water quality is between tap water and wastewater that goes down the drainage. </seg>
<seg id=5> In general, it is widely used for flushing toilets, watering gardens and farmlands, cleaning roads, washing cars, and supplementing the water in city fountains and cooling facilities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> A study by Shenzhen Water Works showed that in the mid 1990s of the 20th century, more than 70 buildings in Shenzhen were equipped with the "middle-water"-recycling system. However, the cost of recycling for "middle-water" was too high due to technological, design, and management factors, thus forcing the construction unit to stop using it. </seg>
<seg id=7> Only RMB 300,000 to 400,000 yuan of extra investment will be needed to install the "middle-water"-treatment system in order for these pipelines to perform their functions properly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> If the more than 70 existing sets of "middle-water" pipelines are being used, according to the present daily usage of 500 tons of "middle-water" in small districts, it will save 35,000 tons of tap water for Shenzhen per day. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> According to information, the Shenzhen "middle-water"-recycling project will start with the remodeling of the more than 70 existing buildings that have the "middle-water"-recycling system. After summarizing the experience, the project will be further expanded. </seg>
<seg id=10> Meanwhile, Shenzhen Water Works will draw up specifications for the "middle-water"-plan with urban planning and development departments as soon as possible and will enforce "middle-water" usage in some larger-scale buildings. </seg>

<seg id=9> Nineteen of the 26 tourists were employees of China United Engineering Corporation. </seg>
<seg id=10> The reporters learned from the company that after the tsunami, the stranded employees called the company for help through their cellular phones. The company thus requested emergency assistance immediately through China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. </seg>

<seg id=13> After the tsunami, the local transportation departments tried their utmost to rescue the wounded. </seg>
<seg id=14> At noon on the 27th, they were safely transported to Phuket Island. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 30 (Reporter Song Shiyi) - Medvedev, Head of the Russian Presidential Administration Office and Chairman of Gazprom, told the press on the 30th that Gazprom will merge with Rosneft in January as planned. However, the assets of Yuganskneftegaz, the largest subsidiary of Yukos purchased by Rosneft, will not be included in the assets of Gazprom. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Moreover, according to reports, when discussing the reason why the assets of the auctioned Yuganskneftegaz will not be included in Gazprom's, Russian Industry and Energy Minister Khristenko stated that it is mainly because the state is already the major shareholder of Gazprom and the state does not want to increase its stake above the controlling-shares limit. </seg>
<seg id=4> He said that Yuganskneftegaz's assets will be removed independently and transferred to an entirely state-owned company. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> On the 19th of this month, the Russian Federal Property Foundation held a public auction on 76.79 percent of Yuganskneftegaz's shares, the largest subsidiary of Yukos. The newly established Baikal Financial Group won the bid with U.S. $9.35 billion. </seg>
<seg id=6> On the 22nd, the state-owned Gazprom announced that it had bought the shares of Baikal Finance Group, the company that won the bid of Yuganskneftegaz's shares, thus becoming its new owner. </seg>

<seg id=1> (Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan) Research Institute Predicts: Around 6 Percent Growth in Hong Kong Economy in 2005 </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, January 11 (Reporter Suxiao) - The APEC Study Center of the University of Hong Kong stated on the 11th that this year's global economic outlook is still optimistic. The Hong Kong economy is expected to have an approximate 6 percent increase this year, with a 4.4 percent growth on an annual basis in the first quarter. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Richard Wong, the Director of the APEC Study Center of the University of Hong Kong, stated in the "Hong Kong Macroeconomic Forecast" press conference that even though the interest rate is expected to rise this year, the economic growth of Hong Kong's major economic partners will be weak, and the respective 3.6 percent and 8.5 percent growth in the U.S. and Mainland Chinese economies, the global economic environment in 2005 is still optimistic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> He stated that the center predicts an approximate 6 percent growth in the Hong Kong economy in 2005, while the consumer prices at year-end will rise by 3 percent. </seg>
<seg id=5> The adjustment of the labor market is still slow and the unemployment rate will drop slightly to roughly 6.3 percent at year-end. </seg>
<seg id=6> The unstable situation caused by fluctuations in global oil prices is still the major uncertain factor affecting the Hong Kong economy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Alan Siu, the Executive Director of the center said that the momentum of the economic growth in the first quarter will slow down and the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will have a 4.4 percent increase. The slowdown reflects a weakening external demand for Hong Kong due to an even slower economic growth of Hong Kong's major trading partners. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> According to the report, the real GDP growth of Hong Kong in 2004 will record a strong 8 percent increase and the average consumer price level slightly drops by 0.5 percent, while deflation disappeared in the third quarter of last year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Chow Yei-Ching, the Chairman of the Steering Committee of the Hong Kong Macroeconomic Forecast of the Hong Kong University, stated that the robust growth of the Hong Kong economy in 2004 mainly reflects the sound fundamentals of the local economy. The foreign trade market is competitive and is able to capitalize on the strong global economic growth and the economic growth in the Mainland last year. The ending of deflation also enables businesses to have more cash flow. </seg>

<seg id=1> Eurozone Indicators This Week will Suggest Weak European Economy to Continue </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Economists said Eurozone economic indicators to be released this week would show further evidence of weak economic confidence and slowing economic output, while British data was expected to show increased industrial activity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> They said economic output data from the largest Eurozone countries would continue to indicate great volatility each month, but the long-term trend of economic output would suggest slowing economic growth. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> The most crucial figure of the week will be from Germany, where the ZEW institute's economic expectations indicator, which is closely monitored by the market, is due on the 7th and will provide the first evidence of economic confidence in Europe for December. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> The ZEW index slumped to 13.9 in November from 31.3 in the previous month. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> The euro's significant appreciation would continue to weigh on economic confidence in the recent surveys, so there's no reason to expect the indicator to rebound, economists said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> "Considering that the main factors driving down economic confidence, including the euro's appreciation, uncertainty in the global economy, and a worsening unemployment rate in the German job market have been a drag on future growth expectations during the December survey, a strong rebound in the index is unlikely," economists at BNP said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> According to a survey among economists conducted by AFX News, the AFP financial news services, the indicator will slip again to 11.0 in December from 13.9 in the previous month. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> But Teather of the UBS investment bank said Germany's ZEW economic expectations indicator could even drop to zero in December. </seg>

<seg id=3> In a newspaper interview yesterday, Kean, the former Republican governor of New Jersey responsible for an investigation into the September 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington in the US, said the problem with the intelligence reform bill was that it had to go through Congress, and the process alone bode ill for future bipartisan cooperation and the president's domestic agenda. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Ukraine heads into a third week of turmoil caused by the presidential election, amid which opposition leader Yushchenko today called on supporters to keep up the street struggle by besieging the presidential palace and government buildings until outgoing president Kuchma sacks Prime Minister Yanukovich and his cabinet members and takes steps to ensure the new upcoming presidential run-off is fair. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Thousands of Yushchenko's supporters have massed in the capital Kiev for two weeks, besieging government buildings and camping in the main avenue specially designed by Soviet experts for viewing military parades. The power of people Yushchenko's supporters demonstrated forced the Supreme Court to annul the November 21 second-round presidential election and the General Election Commission to order a repeat of the runoff on December 26. While parliament has already voted to sack Yanukovich, Kuchma has not signed a decree to replace the successor whom he's been grooming. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Yushchenko tonight told supporters who gathered at Independence Square in the capital city that Kuchma should replace his administration and reshuffle the General Election Commission, and that both parliament and Kuchma should agree to revise the election law to prevent vote rigging. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> He said in a speech serving as the prelude to the December 26 runoff that "until these decisions are made, there can be no talk of lifting the blockade of the government buildings or the presidential palace. </seg>
<seg id=6> For 14 days this square has demonstrated a love of Ukraine and the civic awareness of millions of Ukrainians who are capable of defending their choice." </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> More than one billion children, half of the world's population of children, suffer from the scourge of poverty, war and rampant AIDS, said an annual report released today by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The rights of children to a healthy and secure growing environment, as laid out in the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child, are often jeopardized, due in part to the failure of governments to implement human rights and economic reforms, UNICEF said. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=4> "When half of the world's children are growing up in a hungry and unhealthy environment, when schools become targets of attacks and whole villages are destroyed by AIDS, we can no longer deliver on our promise to children," UNICEF executive director Ms. Bellamy said while releasing the annual report in London. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> "Too many governments are making deliberate decisions that actually hurt children," Bellamy said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Statistics compiled through the joint efforts of researchers from UNICEF, Britain's London School of Economics and Bristol University have revealed a terrible scenario of children at risk in much of the world. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Researchers found that some 640 million children around the world lack adequate shelter, 400 million children have no access to safe drinking water, 270 million children have no access to health care services, and 140 million children (mostly girls) have never been to school. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=2> The European Union today rebuffed pressure from China's Premier Wen Jiabao for a quick end to the arms embargo on China, but said it would work towards lifting the 15-year-old embargo. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The EU's rotating president, the Netherlands, made the above comments after a China-EU summit. </seg>
<seg id=4> The Netherlands said there was no need to speculate on how the EU would end the embargo. </seg>
<seg id=5> The EU imposed the arms embargo on Beijing after the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Though the issue of the arms embargo has shadowed the China-EU summit, the two parties signed several trade and other agreements during the meeting. </seg>
<seg id=7> Both China and the EU hailed the agreements as having strengthened the "strategic partnership" between them. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> "The EU side confirmed its political will to continue to work towards lifting the embargo," said the EU, in a joint statement released after the summit with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=9> The statement said that the Chinese delegation "welcomed the positive message and considered it beneficial to the sound development of the comprehensive strategic partnership between China and the EU". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Wen Jiabao did not hide his displeasure at a press conference after the summit, saying the embargo "fails to reflect the partnership between China and the EU". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> "The embargo is a result of the Cold War and does not reflect the present situation or the partnership between China and the EU," Wen Jiabao said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> Some EU countries led by France are pushing for a lifting of the embargo, saying the ban is outdated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=13> Without amending or strengthening related EU laws, some farsighted people in the EU worry that lifting the embargo could open the floodgates to arms sales, which could boost China's military forces. </seg>

<seg id=1> Preliminary Study Finding: Folic Acid May Lead to Breast Cancer, but No Conclusion Made </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> A latest heath study reported that "folic acid," a vitamin B widely taken by pregnant women to prevent fetal malformation, may increase the risk of breast cancer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> But the researchers said their results could merely be the result of chance, as other studies have suggested that folic acid actually reduces the risk of breast cancer, so they urged pregnant women to continue taking the supplement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Folic acid is found naturally in dark, leafy vegetables and is known to the medical community as a crucial aid in the growth of the fetus. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Researchers from the universities of Bristol and Aberdeen in Britain followed 3,000 women who took either five milligrams or 0.2 milligrams of folic acid or a placebo in the 1960s when they were pregnant, mostly during the second and third phases of their pregnancy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> By September 2002, breast cancer rates among those women who took the five-milligram folic acid were twice as high as those who took the placebo alone, said the report published in a British medical magazine. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Ness, one of the researchers, stressed the results were merely "preliminary ... aimed at pointing out the way for further research." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> "It is entirely possible that this is a result of chance, so further scientific studies are required to examine the association, if there is any, before we reach any conclusions," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Ness said women planning to become pregnant should still take folic acid supplements. </seg>
<seg id=10> He said the current dosage recommendation "is far from the experimental dosage." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> According to British health guidelines, women hoping to become pregnant or in the first phase of their pregnancy should take 0.4 microgram folic acid daily, which is more than 10 times smaller than the doses taken by those women in the study described above. </seg>

<seg id=2> Following his meeting with US Secretary of State Powell today, French Foreign Minister Barnier said restoration of the Middle East peace talks would "test" their trans-Atlantic relations. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=5> While both Paris and Washington agreed to mend their strained ties after the US invasion of Iraq last year, there were still obvious differences on resolving the Middle East impasse. </seg>

<seg id=6> "We hope to improve the future ties between France and the US and between Europe and America," Barnier said after a brief discussion with Powell at the US State Department. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> "I think the test at the heart of this relationship is our ability to push ahead the peace process between Palestine and Israel," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Barnier called earlier this week for an early international seminar on the Middle East to take advantage of what he called a "window of opportunity" that emerged after Arafat's death last month. </seg>

<seg id=2> Japanese Foreign Minister Nobutaka Machimura proposed today that Japan and South Korea hold talks on signing a free trade agreement (FTA) at an early date in January next year. </seg>
<seg id=3> Jiji Press reported that in a meeting with South Korean Foreign Affairs and Trade Minister Ban Ki-Moon in Ibusuki City, southern Japan's Kagoshima Prefecture, Machimura said the two sides should resume talks at an early date as authorities in Tokyo and Seoul both expected to sign an FTA by the end of 2005. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=2> On the eve of 2005, Thai Prime Minister Thaksin is confident of winning a second four-year term, but his reputation is tarnished for his failure to quell a bloody separatist insurgency. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> With Thai national elections scheduled for February 6 next year, Thaksin and his political rivals are gearing up for the election campaign. Most analysts believe that despite the fierce violent conflicts in the south and the bird flu, he is still expected to win. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=4> A total of 12 people died in Thailand this year from bird flu, which swept across much of Asia but was particularly severe in Thailand, where the Thai government acknowledged it "made mistakes" in coping with the epidemic. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Arafat was poisoned a year ago when he received a delegation of supporters in the Ramallah headquarters, the late Palestinian leader Arafat's cabinet secretary Abdelrahman disclosed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> "Something strange happened to Arafat around a year ago, on September 25, 2003," Abdelrahman told the Al-Hayat newspaper. </seg>
<seg id=4> "At that time, the president vomited after shaking hands one by one with some 30 supporter representatives. </seg>
<seg id=5> The president's health started deteriorating from then on." </seg>

<p>
<seg id=6> Arafat died in a French hospital of an unknown illness on November 11. </seg>
<seg id=7> Several top Palestinian officials believed Arafat had been poisoned. </seg>
<seg id=8> But French doctors said there was no medical basis for such allegations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Two weeks before the visit of the delegation mentioned by Abdelrahman, the Israeli Prime Minister Sharon's cabinet had just made a decision to "remove" Arafat from his post, although without specifying by what means. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Israel's threat triggered waves of public support for Arafat, who therefore received several supporter delegations. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Currently, around four million Japanese, or six percent of Japan's 63.2 million working population, use technology to work away from their offices, said an official with the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications. </seg>

<seg id=5> Depending on their feedback, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications will then expand this advanced program until 20 percent of its 2,500 employees are able to work from home by 2006. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> He said telecommuting would allow workers to spend more time with their family, allowing bread earners to give more help with household duties. </seg>

<seg id=1> Political Intervention in NHK Program? Debate Erupts in Japanese Media </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Allegations that pressures from politicians forced the public-run Japan Broadcasting Corporation (NHK) to shorten a program aired a few years ago on Japan's slavery of comfort women during World War II have left liberal Japanese media at odds with their conservative counterparts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Liberal Japanese media have assailed NHK for slashing large portions of interviews it had conducted, mostly with critics of Japan's wartime conduct and victims of enslaved comfort women, allegedly after discussions with senior political leaders. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> But conservative newspapers have justified NHK's decision to edit the show, believing the company's senior management has a duty to ensure its programs are fair and objective. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> The controversy erupted last week over a 2001 program that featured a mock trial on the crime of the Japanese military of enslaving comfort women during wartime. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> The trial, held by a women's rights group in Tokyo in December 2000, found the late Emperor Hirohito guilty of allowing the slavery of comfort women by Japanese military during Japan's occupation of Asian nations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Historians say at least 200,000 young women, mostly from Korea but also from Taiwan, China, the Philippines, and Indonesia, were forced to serve as comfort women in frontline Japanese military brothels during wartime. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> The program's producer Satoru Nagai held a tearful press conference on the 13th, disclosing that before the program was aired, senior NHK officials met with lawmakers of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, Shinzo Abe and Shoichi Nakagawa, both of whom had expressed concerns over the content of the program. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Nagai said top NHK officials then edited and shortened the program. </seg>
<seg id=10> "NHK bowed to political pressure," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> Abe and Nakagawa admitted meeting with NHK officials and telling them to be "fair" but firmly denied pressuring the company. </seg>

<seg id=4> Zhao Ziyang once served as the general secretary of the CCP and premier.

<seg id=5> The Information Center said that according to Zao's family, the sitting Premier Wen Jiabao, who once worked as Zhao Ziyang's subordinate, did not visit him when he was critically ill. </seg>
<seg id=6> But retired Central Committee member and his one-time aide Tian Jiyun visited him before Zhao Ziyang slipped into a coma on the 14th. </seg>

Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, the Taiwanese government, and overseas Chinese democracy activists all coincided in appeals to Beijing to carry out Zhao Ziyang's vision of democratic reforms. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Zhao was dismissed from office in 1989 for opposing the military suppression of the democratic movement at Tiananmen Square. He was put under house arrest for the rest of his life and died this morning at a Beijing hospital at the age of 85. </seg>

<seg id=9> Democratic activists have requested China hold a public funeral for Zhao Ziyang and give fair appraisal for his achievements. </seg>

<seg id=3> Using this rapid assay to test specimens from suspected cases, the diagnosis of bird flu infection can be made in as short as less than an hour. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Based on existing information, bird flu, which is listed as a highly toxic killer virus, has a mortality rate far higher than that of the SARS virus, said Professor Guan Yi, director of the Shantou University's Medical College/University of Hong Kong's Medical Faculty Joint Influenza Research Center. </seg>
<seg id=5> Previously it would take between 3 to 5 days, and sometimes more than a week to confirm "suspected" viruses. </seg>
<seg id=6> The successfully introduced rapid test for bird flu viruses uses the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the gold-labeling assay to test specimens such as excreta, nasal pharyngeal secretions, chick embryo-cultured intact virus or split virus, as well as serum. The diagnosis of bird flu virus infection may be reached in one to two hours. </seg>
<seg id=7> The new techniques are easy, convenient and rapid, and allow for detection in the outbreak site. With an accuracy of more than 90 percent, they help with early detection, early diagnosis, early isolation and early treatment of the infectious virus, avoiding wide epidemic and severe plague. </seg>
</p>

<p>
<seg id=2> CUSCO (Peru), December 7, Xinhua (Reporters Liu Guoqiang and Wang Lu) A special meeting of the Andean Community (ANCOM) Presidential Council opened on the 7th in Peru's famous tourist city of Cusco. </seg>
<seg id=3> Presidents or delegates attending the meeting will hold discussions on plans to deepen integration of the Andean region and on the promotion of economic and social development. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> In a message delivered at the opening ceremony of the meeting, Peru's President Toledo said it had been 35 years since the establishment of ANCOM, but major problems such as poverty were still unresolved. </seg>
<seg id=5> At present the poverty rate in the Andean region is as high as 53 percent, posing a serious threat to the region's democratic governance. </seg>
<seg id=6> Therefore, ANCOM member governments should seek to establish effective mechanisms to get rid of poverty and to promote public participation in national affairs, so as to improve social stability and development. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Toledo said that although quite a few issues were yet to be addressed within the ANCOM, great progress had been made towards South American integration, and the establishment of a South American Community of Nations would be announced at the Third South American Summit to be held here on the 8th. </seg>
<seg id=8> He expressed his belief that the creation of the new regional bloc would play a vital role in promoting the region's political, economic and social development. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Apart from Toledo, Bolivian President Mesa also attended the meeting. </seg>
<seg id=10> Colombian President Uribe, Ecuadorian President Gutierrez, and Venezuelan President Chavez were unable to attend the meeting due to different reasons, but they will come to the Third South American Summit to be held here on the 8th. </seg>

<seg id=1> Construction of Underground Power Plant to Begin Soon for Three Gorges Project </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> WUHAN, December 8, Xinhua (Reporter Shi Yongfeng) Bids were publicly invited for the first time on December 8 for the main part of an underground power plant for the Three Gorges Project, a prelude to the construction of the Three Gorges underground power plant. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The Three Gorges Project is designed to install twenty-six 700,000-kilowatt hydraulic generator units, with an installed capacity of 18.2 million kilowatts. Once the generator units are all in production, the average power generation per year will be 84.7 billion kilowatt hours. </seg>
<seg id=4> With the aim to further explore the power generating potential of the Three Gorges Project, the Three Gorges Project has reserved spaces in its initial design for building an underground powerhouse as an extension project. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> According to officials at the China Three Gorges Project Corporation, the Three Gorges underground power plant is laid out in the mountains on the right bank of the Three Gorges Dam, with major buildings such as the intake tower, diversion tunnel, main plant, tailrace system, busbar shaft and 500kv transformer substation. </seg>
<seg id=6> The underground power plant will have six 700,000-kilowatt generator units. </seg>
<seg id=7> This will increase the number of generator units installed in the Three Gorges Project to 32 from 26 designed originally and the installed capacity will soar to 22.4 million kilowatts from 18.2 million kilowatts, which will significantly strengthen the power generation capability of the Three Gorges Project. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Flood Prevention is the top priority for building the Three Gorges Project. </seg>
<seg id=9> Based on the operation schedule of the Three Gorges Reservoir, the water level in the Three Gorges Reservoir will be lowered from the normal pond level of 175m to the flood control level of 145m each year before the flood season. </seg>
<seg id=10> Therefore, the construction of the underground power plant will increase the water usage rate of the Three Gorges Reservoir, reduce water loss and increase power generation, thus maximizing the time of peak regulation without water loss. </seg>
<seg id=11> Currently, the earlier phase projects of the Three Gorges underground power plant, such as adit excavation, tailrace canal excavation and timbering, have begun in advance. </seg>
<seg id=12> It is said that the underground power plant will be fully completed and put into production by the end of 2008. </seg>

<seg id=4> The Bose Uprising is another successful armed uprising led independently by the Communist Party of China after the Nanchang Uprising, the Qiushou Uprising and the Guangzhou Uprising. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> SHANGHAI, December 13, Xinhua (Reporter Liu Dan) "China's Youth Social Education Forum -- 2004 Media and Minor Development" that closed in Shanghai on the 13th proposed that China should set up a spokesperson system about the conditions of minors, which regularly releases news about their development status and problems. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> A survey conducted by a relevant organization in Shanghai showed that minors read extra curriculum books for an average of 1.17 hours per day per person, watch TV for 1.05 hours, and browse the Internet for 0.99 hours, meaning that in the extra curriculum schedule of minors, about half the time is spent with the media. And the media is becoming a factor not negligible in minors' growth and development as a brand new social force. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> "The media is a window linking the minds of the young to the outside world. Once the window opens, fresh air will flow in together with flies and mosquitoes," </seg>
<seg id=5> said Chen Tianqiao, chairman of Shanghai's Shanda Networking Development Co., Ltd. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> While the media is creating good conditions for minors to grow up soundly, the need for market competition and economic interests, plus the low quality of some media staff, has made opinions in some articles misleading for the thinking and values of teenagers, and some media even spread violent and pornographic content. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Currently there are over 2,000 television channels and more than 1,500 radio frequencies in China broadcasting 1,868 radio programs, and the number of net surfers within the country is as high as 87 million. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Organizers of the forum said that the creation of a spokesman system for minors could provide authoritative survey data on the status and problems of adolescent development and change the current status of "disorderly voices" from the media, so as to offer a sound and favorable public opinion environment for the raising of minors. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> In a speech delivered at the "Arab Strategy Forum" in Dubai, Zebari said it's very important that Iraq holds the elections as scheduled, because the elections not only decide Iraq's new leader, but also define Iraq as a free, democratic and united country belonging to all Iraqis. </seg>
<seg id=4> He expressed his belief that the future Iraqi government will be a legitimate administration representing the Iraqi people and expressing their wishes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Zebari said the US-led coalition is in Iraq to protect the country at the request of Iraq, since the current Interim Iraqi Government cannot control the security situation and lacks the ability to wipe out terrorists and saboteurs. </seg>
<seg id=6> The existence of the coalition has a time limit. According to UN resolutions, this will end after Iraq has completed its political process and a legitimate government has emerged. </seg>

<seg id=1> (International) United Nations Warns More Death from Drug Abuse Expected Globally in 2005 </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> VIENNA, December 17, Xinhua (Reporter Song Guocheng) Costa, Executive Director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, warned in a press release on the 17th that due to increased heroin yield in Afghanistan, heroin is expected to trade at a stable price in black markets in 2005 and with higher purity, causing more deaths among drug users. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Costa has sent warnings to officials at health and drug prevention organizations in Europe and surrounding countries, urging those countries to closely follow the latest trends of drug cultivation in Afghanistan and international drug crime, and take appropriate precautions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> According to statistics from the Vienna-based UN Office on Drugs and Crime, in 2001, when opium cultivation was banned in Afghanistan, heroin yield in Afghanistan declined by 94 percent, and the purity level of heroin in European black markets dropped 50 percent a year later. </seg>
<seg id=5> Deaths from drug abuse in Europe fell by 20 percent from 2000 to 2002. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> Costa said Afghanistan's opium cultivation area this year increased by 64 percent compared to 2003, and heroin yield topped 500 tons, which is more than the volume of global black market heroin trade for the whole year, a trend meaning higher purity on a global scale and commensurate increase in the number of deaths attributed to drug abuse. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Costa believed drug sources in Afghanistan have posed "clear and present threats" to global drug prevention efforts, and a greater supply of heroin in black markets means "death sentences" to drug users. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> It is estimated the number of deaths worldwide from overdoses is approximately 100,000 a year. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> WASHINGTON, December 20, Xinhua (Reporters Pan Yunzhao and Tan Xinmu) Gordon England, Navy Secretary of the US Defense Department said at a Pentagon press conference on the 20th that a military review panel had confirmed a prisoner held at the US naval base in Guantanamo was not an enemy combatant and would be released soon. </seg>
<seg id=3> This is the second Guantanamo prisoner the US military has ruled out as an enemy combatant. </seg>
<seg id=4> England said the Pentagon confirmed the prisoner's identity a few days ago, and the State Department would inform the prisoner's country of this decision and make arrangements for his release. </seg>
<seg id=5> But he didn't disclose the prisoner's name or nationality, and the circumstances under which he was captured. </seg>
<seg id=6> England refused to admit that the Defense Department had made a mistake in determining the identity of the Guantanamo prisoner. </seg>
<seg id=7> He said the military review panel responsible for reviewing the identity of Guantanamo prisoners reviewed 507 prisoners, confirming the identity of 230, of whom 228 were correctly classified as enemy combatants. </seg>
<seg id=8> The United States has released some 200 Guantanamo prisoners so far; some were freed after repatriation to their home counties and a few others are still in jail after their return, but at least 12 have taken part in activities against the US troops after being released. </seg>
<seg id=9> Around 550 "Al-Qaeda" and Taliban suspects are currently being held at the US naval base in Guantanamo, most captured during the US-Afghan war. </seg>

<seg id=1> Top-Level Node for Country Code Domains Settles in Shanghai </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> SHANGHAI, December 21, Xinhua (Feng Yizhen and Chen Haiyu) China's Internet Network Information Center and Shanghai's Information Industry (Group) Co., Ltd signed a contract on the 21st on the entry into Shanghai of a top-level node for country code domains. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Domain names, which are now widely used as Internet addresses, are the communication basis for carrying out all Internet applications such as e-business and e-government. </seg>
<seg id=4> When visiting websites or accessing email, people have to first enter domain names. Through the resolution service of a domain name system, domain names are converted to IP addresses, and website hosts are then found, enabling information transfer. </seg>
<seg id=5> A domain name system is like the "nerve system" that controls information transfer on the Internet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> China has more than 90 million Internet users as of now, which is the second largest number worldwide, and the number of websites has topped 650,000, said Mao Wei, director of China's Internet Network Information Center, the administrator of China's country code top-level domain name system. </seg>
<seg id=7> The volume of domain name resolution is proportional to Internet users, and with the fast development of the Internet, the volume of domain name resolution also increases rapidly. </seg>
<seg id=8> At present, registration of CN domains grows by 10,000 every month, with a total number of 430,000. </seg>
<seg id=9> The country code top-level domain name server run and managed by China's Internet Network Information Center processes over 380 million domain name resolution requests every day, with an average of over 4,400 requests processed in one second and a peak value of 8,000. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Faced with the fast development of the Internet, China's Internet Network Information Center, China's domain name registration administration, had to reevaluate this year the four original top-level nodes for country code domains across the country and redeployed CN domain top-level nodes based on the results of said reevaluation. </seg>
<seg id=11> Based on local Internet development and software and hardware conditions at access organizations, it was decided to install a top-level node for country code domains in Shanghai. </seg>
<seg id=12> We learn that Shanghai currently has 45,000 CN domain names and 26.6 percent of the population are Internet users. Its Internet penetration rate and application skills are second to none in the country. </seg>
<seg id=13> The East China region surrounding Shanghai, with 130,000 CN domain names and 230,000 websites, is also a leader in terms of development. </seg>
<seg id=14> Therefore Shanghai was chosen as the first node in the redeployment plan. </seg>

<seg id=1> China Becomes World's Largest Producer of Hard Alloy </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> NANCHANG, December 22, Xinhua (Reporters Yang Yuanyuan and Li Xingwen) The hard alloy industry in China experienced rapid development in recent years, with the annual output exceeding one-third of the global production. In terms of production scale and output, China has become the world's largest hard alloy producer. Offering a complete range of hard alloy types, China can produce most hard alloy products. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> This is what the reporters learned on the 22nd from China's Ganzhou Tungsten Industry Development Strategy Workshop currently being held. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Known as the "industrial tooth," hard alloy is used in cutting tools, high pressure tools, and mechanics of mining and paving engineering for its high rigidity and abrasion resistance. Development of the hard alloy industry is vital to the overall development of the tungsten industry. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> It was mentioned that China's hard alloy industry started from scratch in the 1950s, and after continuously development, it now has made remarkable achievements. </seg>
<seg id=6> In the early 1980s, when the world's annual hard alloy output was 25,000 tons, China produced 5,000 tons of hard alloy a year; stepping into the 21st century, the world's annual hard alloy output is 38,000, while China's hard alloy production per year has soared rapidly to 15,000 tons, or more than one-third of the hard alloy output in the world. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> China has also made significant progress in hard alloy export. </seg>
<seg id=8> China's annual hard alloy export was just 100 tons in 1986, and the export volume had reached 2,500 tons by 2003. The export volume is expected to reach more than 3,000 tons this year, which, like the output, also accounts for one-third of the circulation in worldwide hard alloy markets. The foreign currency earned annually through hard alloy export increased from below four million US dollars a year in the past to 70 million US dollars a year nowadays. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> BEIJING, December 23, Xinhua (Reporter Jiang Guocheng) The reporter learned from the Asian Development Bank's China office on the 23rd that the ADB recently approved a loan of 117.4 million US dollars to help build a power plant that will harness the methane produced from coal mining in the southern part of the Shanxi Province. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The Coalbed Gas Development Demonstration Project will use the latest technologies to boost the output of coalbed and coalfield gas to fuel a 120-megawatt power plant that will soon be built. </seg>
<seg id=4> Under the project, by the time of its completion in 2008, the project will provide about 90,000 households and industrial and commercial users with at least 166 million cubic meters of coalbed gas per year. </seg>
<seg id=5> This will benefit some 410,000 in the Jincheng area. </seg>
<seg id=6> Coal output in Shanxi accounts for about one third of the country's total production. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> The total cost of the project is estimated at 237 million US dollars, of which a loan of 20 million US dollars will be offered by Japan's Bank for International Cooperation and a loan of 37.86 million US dollars will come from the Industrial Bank of China. </seg>
<seg id=8> The Jincheng municipal government and two local mining/industrial groups will provide equity capital totaling 61.24 million US dollars. </seg>
<seg id=9> The United States Trade and Development Agency also provided a grant of 500,000 US dollars. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Methane is called coalbed gas when it is obtained from wells built by drilling from the surface into underground coalbeds, and called coalfield gas when the it is produced in underground coal mining operations. </seg>
<seg id=11> Methane is a highly explosive gas and needs to be drained first in coal mining operations to ensure a safe working environment. </seg>
<seg id=12> Removal, capture and use of methane will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to the alleviation of global warming and climate change. </seg>
<seg id=13> The greenhouse effect of methane is 21 times that of carbon dioxide. </seg>
<seg id=14> Substituting methane for coal increases fuel cleanliness, improves coal mine efficiency, and results in cleaner air. </seg>
<seg id=15> Hassing, an ADB senior project specialist, said the project was expected to yield a reduction of about 4.5 million tons in carbon dioxide greenhouse gas emission. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> JERUSALEM, December 24, (Xinhua) James Snyder, director of the Israel Museum, said on the 24th that the main treasure of the museum, an ivory pomegranate, was confirmed a forgery a few days ago. </seg>
<seg id=3> The ivory pomegranate was once considered the only relic discovered to date from the First Temple of Solomon's age. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Snyder said in a statement that Israeli authorities conducted careful appraisal of the thumb-sized ivory pomegranate. </seg>
<seg id=5> Experts found it should be a relic from the Bronze Age, far earlier than the First Temple period of the Jews. </seg>
<seg id=6> A line of text on the pomegranate, in Hebrew, reads: "Belonging to the Temple of Lord Yahweh, a holy thing to the priests." </seg>
<seg id=7> The inscription was confirmed to have been carved later. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> The Israel Museum bought this ivory pomegranate for 550,000 US dollars from an anonymous collector in the 1980s. </seg>
<seg id=9> Archaeological and relic experts had believed it was an artifact studded on the top of a scepter for priests of the First Temple, and the only cultural heritage left from that age. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Snyder said that before the ivory pomegranate was purchased, it had been authenticated by Israeli experts including an archaeologist named Nahman Avigad. </seg>
<seg id=11> Israel's Haaretz newspaper reported Avigad examined the artifact recklessly at that time using only a magnifier. </seg>
<seg id=12> Avigad has personally denied the comment. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=13> In recent months, Israeli police successively detected three major cases of fraudulence in cultural relics, summoning several hundred people for interrogation. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> GUANGZHOU, December 26 (Xinhua) As a major effort to build a "water-saving city," Shenzhen will enforce the use of "reclaimed water" in some larger buildings and neighborhoods. At present, relevant codes and regulations for the design of reclaimed water facilities are being formulated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> "Reclaimed water" mainly refers to nonpotable water that is for limited use and obtained from treating urban sewage or domestic sewage to a certain a level of water quality. </seg>
<seg id=4> The quality of the water is somewhere between tap water and drained sewage. </seg>
<seg id=5> A large quantity is usually used in toilet flushing, garden and farmland irrigation, road cleaning, car washing, urban fountains, and water refilling for cooling equipment. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> An inquiry conducted by the Shenzhen Water Bureau shows Shenzhen once had more than 70 buildings equipped with a "reclaimed water" recycling system in the middle 1990s, but the builders had to give up the utilization as the cost of "reclaimed water" recycling was too high due to factors such as technology, design and management. </seg>
<seg id=7> To have these pipelines play a real role, what needs to be done is to simply invest an additional 300,000 to 400,000 yuan in installing a "reclaimed water" treatment system. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> If utilized, the over 70 existing "reclaimed water" pipelines can save 35,000 tons of tap water for Shenzhen in one single day, based on each neighborhood using 500 tons of "reclaimed water" per day. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=9> It was said that Shenzhen will start its "reclaimed water" recycling by renovating the over 70 buildings that have existing "reclaimed water" systems, and will further expand the project after summing up experience. </seg>
<seg id=10> In the meantime, the Shenzhen municipal water department will work with the urban planning and construction departments to formulate as soon as possible codes for the design of reclaimed water, and prescribe the enforcement of "reclaimed water" use in larger buildings. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> The tourists just got on the beach, when the wave began to come in. People mistakenly thought that was the tide, so they didn't pay too much attention. </seg>
<seg id=6> When the tour guide Cai Weiwei found that the tide was coming in strongly, she advised everybody to run as soon as possible to a beachside hotel to avoid the danger. </seg>
<seg id=7> By the time people ran into the hotel lobby, the wave had flooded the entrance of the hotel. </seg>
<seg id=8> The hotel was three stories high, and the gust of waves swelled to the second floor, so everybody had to stay on the top of the building in bewilderment. It was fortunate that the wave didn't continue to swell. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Talking about the reason why assets of the auctioned Yugansk will not be incorporated into Gazprom's assets, Russian Minister of Industry and Energy Khristenko said on the same day that it is primarily because the state is already the principal shareholder of Gazpromneft and has no intention of increasing any shares beyond the controlling shares, reports also said. </seg>

<seg id=2> CHENNAI (India), December 31, Xinhua (Reporter Jiang Yaping) Tamil Nadu's Province located in southeastern India had a well developed fishery industry. </seg>
<seg id=3> The province has over one thousand kilometers of coastline, exporting 370,000 tons of marine products each year and earning 23 billion rupees (1 dollar = 43 rupees) of foreign currency for the local government. </seg>
<seg id=4> However, the rare and massive tsunami on the 26th caused by fierce earthquakes in the Indian Ocean has battered local fishery production to an unprecedented extent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> According to authoritative fishery sources in Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu's Province, the sudden disaster had huge impact on the province's fishery production. </seg>
<seg id=6> As there were no alerts or warnings, fishing boats were all berthed at the harbor. </seg>
<seg id=7> The result was more than 7,000 motor boats and over 30,000 vessels destroyed to various degrees, accounting for more than 80 percent of all boats. There were also over 30,000 fishing nets that were destroyed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> A high official at the Chennai Fishery Federation said on the 31st in an interview with a reporter of our agency that even if the fishing boats were fixed, fishermen would not dare to sail off in the next few months, because they witnessed in person the atrocity and cruelty of the sea. </seg>
<seg id=9> Some deprived of their relatives and some suffering losses of property, the fear in their mind would remain for quite a long time. </seg>
<seg id=10> It is estimated that fishery output of the province in 2005 will drop around 30 percent from that of 2004. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> The tsunami disaster on the 26th impacted most coastal fishing villages in Tamil Nadu's Province, making it the worst hit area in India. </seg>
<seg id=12> By the 30th, the death toll in the province had reached 6230, of whom most were fishermen. </seg>
<seg id=13> It is said approximately 680,000 people in the province are affected by the tsunami, and 85 percent of them are in the fishery production. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=14> Currently the Indian government is actively carrying out relief operations, trying to restore local fishermen's life and fishery production as soon as possible. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> HONG KONG, January 11, Xinhua (Reporter Su Xiao) The APEC Study Center of the University of Hong Kong said on the 11th that the global economic environment remains favorable this year, and that Hong Kong's economy is expected to develop at around 6 percent with an annualized 4.4 percent growth in the first quarter. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Richard Wong, Director of the APEC Study Center at HKU, pointed out in the press conference of the "Hong Kong Macroeconomic Forecast" that although interest rates are expected to be hiked this year, the economic growths of Hong Kong's major trade partners keep sluggish, and the economic growths of the United States and the Mainland China are respectively 3.6 percent and 8.5 percent, the global economic environment remains promising in 2005. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> He said that according to the forecast of the center, the economic growth of Hong Kong will remain at around 6 percent in 2005, but consumer prices will increase by 3 percent at the end of the year. </seg>
<seg id=5> Job market adjustment remains sluggish with the unemployment rate declining slightly to around 6.3 percent by the end of this year. </seg>
<seg id=6> Uncertainties caused by the fluctuations of the global oil price are still the main uncertain factor in Hong Kong's economy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Alan Siu, Executive Director of the Study Center, said that the economic growth momentum in the first quarter of this year will turn moderate, and GDP will grow at 4.4 percent. The slowdown reflects a gradual weakening in Hong Kong's demand for foreign goods, as the economic growth of Hong Kong's major trading partners tends to be even slower. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> According to the report, the real GDP of Hong Kong in 2004 will record a robust growth of 8 percent with the average consumer price level declining by only 0.5 percent, as deflation disappeared in the third quarter of last year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Chow Yei-Ching, chairman of the Steering Committee of the Hong Kong Macroeconomic Forecast at HKU, remarked that Hong Kong's economy in 2004 showed a strong growth, and that reflects mainly the sound fundamentals of the local economy. The external sector is very competitive and is able to capitalize on the strong global economic growth and the rapid development of the market economy in mainland China last year. The ending of deflation will enable business owners to enjoy stronger cash flows. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=2> Bahraini princess Meriam Al-Khalifa's marriage with the humble US marine Johnson was once a widely hailed story by US television channels. However, their thorny marriage has now ended in the desert gambling town of Las Vegas after lasting for just five years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The fairy-tale marriage between Meriam, a member of the Gulf state of Bahrain's royal family, and US marine Johnson, who devoted himself to this banned love affair, risking his military career, became the subject of a television movie. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> But the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported that merely five years had passed before the couple confronted each other in court when Meriam filed for divorce in the gambling town where procedures for marriages are quick and for dissolutions are quicker. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> The two met in 1999 when Johnson was a career army man stationed in Bahrain. </seg>
<seg id=6> But his life changed dramatically when he met the young teenage princess and the pair fell in love. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> The young couple's union was forbidden by the royal family, so Johnson disguised Meriam in a flannel shirt and a baseball cap and forged her military identification papers, taking her out of her home country to the US. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> After a bitter immigration lawsuit against US authorities, the couple married at the Candlelight Wedding Chapel on the Las Vegas Strip famed for its magnificence when Johnson was 23 and the bride was only 19. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> But Johnson said the wealth of temptations in the "sin city" of Las Vegas, ongoing tensions with Meriam's wealthy and powerful family, and rumors of a plot to assassinate him had finally contributed to the breakup of the thorny marriage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Johnson said he made a living parking cars for hotel and casino guests, while Meriam increasingly indulged in the nightlife of the gambling town, frequenting night clubs late at night and ignoring him as her husband. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> Meriam abandoned her husband a year ago. </seg>

<seg id="1"> China's New Management Rules for E-banking Operations to Take Effect on March 1 </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 6 (Correspondents Han Jie and Xu Bo) On the 6th, reporters learned from the China Banking Regulatory Commission that the Measures for Administration of E-banking Business and the Security Evaluation Guidance on E-banking issued recently by the CBRC will take effect on March 1, 2006. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> A CBRC spokesperson said that according to the rules of the Measures for Administration, relevant approval methods for foreign financial institutions basically remain unchanged, that is, after a foreign bank branch is approved to initiate e-banking operations, if new types of e-banking operations need to be added, the main reporting office in China for such bank branch should submit a uniform application for review and approval. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In order to standardize e-banking operations of commercial banks, the People's Bank of China promulgated the Interim Measures for Administration of E-banking Business in June 2001. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The CBRC spokesperson said that with the continuous development of commercial bank e-banking operations, the Interim Measures can no longer meet the requirements of e-banking risk supervision.  Therefore, the CBRC formulated these two new rules. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> According to the introduction by the CBRC spokesperson, CBRC accreditation of security evaluation institutions is different from administrative approvals concerning the entrance eligibility of industries or enterprises.  It is not a necessary condition for evaluation institutions to carry out e-banking security evaluation business, but rather serves as a reference for financial institutions for selecting evaluation institutions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> As long as a security evaluation institution meets the relevant conditions and requirements, even if it does not have CBRC accreditation, financial institutions can still hire it to conduct e-banking security evaluation, though management shall be carried out in accordance with relevant regulations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The Measures for Administration of E-banking Business include 99 articles under nine chapters, with the nine sections covering general provisions, applications and amendments, risk management, administration of data exchange and transfer, outsourcing business, administration of transnational business, supervision and management, legal obligations, and by-laws. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The Security Evaluation Guidance on E-banking includes 57 articles under five chapters, with the five sections covering general provisions, security evaluation institutions, implementation of security evaluations, administration of security evaluation activities, and by-laws. </seg>

<seg id="1"> (Selected Excerpts from Newspapers and Magazines) Shanghai: Moonlighters and College Graduates Become Main Hourly Workforce </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 7   The Shanghai Labor and Social Security Bureau released the latest 2006 wage guidelines for hourly workers on the 6th.  The number of job positions reached 120, 11 more than the previous time, while the prevailing wages in previous existing positions had increases and decreases. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> According to estimates by relevant experts at the Shanghai Labor and Social Security Bureau, currently the number of hourly workers in Shanghai has exceeded 1 million. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to a China Youth Daily report, the hourly workforce is mainly composed of college graduates and moonlighters. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> A direct survey of nearly 8,000 hourly workers found more than half of them are moonlighters, accounting for 51.1%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In general, moonlighters have relatively higher levels of education and are mainly engaged in more technically focused work.  For instance, among translation-related jobs, the percentage of moonlighters has reached 81.7%, while it has reached 61.6% for people in fitness professions. </seg>
<seg id="7"> High wages are one of the major reasons for many people to get second jobs as hourly workers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> It was learned that some specific positions such as simultaneous interpreters can earn monthly incomes of tens of thousands of yuan and are also in high demand.  Most hourly workers such as freelance accountants or masters of ceremony at weddings can make more than 2,000 yuan a month. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Satisfying personal interests and expanding knowledge are also major reasons why hourly work appeals to people. </seg>
<seg id="10"> For example, Mr. Gu, a human resources manager in a company, spends a few hours each week doing accounting for the representative office of a foreign company. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Mr. Gu thinks the greatest benefit of the second job is that it allows him to continuously update his knowledge and to have the chance to get involved in another field.  Of course, the monthly income of 2,000 yuan certainly has some appeal as well. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> As some hourly positions have low minimum requirements and work styles which are flexible and independent, they are gradually gaining favor among many graduates looking for jobs.  Some 14% of hourly workers are college or technical school graduates from within the past three years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> "At first I didn't want to be an hourly worker.  Yet after working for a few months, I feel it is better than working from 9 to 5." </seg>
<seg id="14"> Xiao Huang, whose job after college was not satisfying, eventually signed up with a hotel to play background music on the piano. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "I am quite satisfied with my current job.  It pays 100 yuan per hour and has a nice environment too.  What I need to do now is find a few more hourly positions." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> It was learned that working at hourly positions has become an important approach for some job-seeking graduates to accumulate work experience, practice work skills, enhance communication skills, and increase exposure to society. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Hourly jobs taken by graduates are mainly concentrated in knowledge-based and more technically focused positions.  For instance, specialty focused jobs like those related to translation and trendy entertainment account for 22.1% and 26.8%, respectively. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Some hourly jobs require few skills, such as food salespeople and inventory workers.  Laid-off workers can start work right after minimal training. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Statistics show that among hourly workers, 39% were previously laid-off workers.  Among them, the unemployed working in the retail sector has reached 68.4%, while the percentage in the catering sector has reached 58.7%.  Hourly jobs have become a major channel for the jobless to get reemployed. </seg>

<seg id="11"> We should foster social consciousness toward innovation, vigorously advocate a brave innovative and competitive spirit, and focus on creating a good environment for people of talent to come forth in large numbers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Wu Bangguo noted that the NPC is playing an increasingly large role in pushing forth governance of the State by law and construction of a socialist country by the rule of law. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In order to carry out NPC work under new situations, first, we should adhere to the correct political direction, resolutely stay on the road of socialist political development with Chinese characteristics, and organically integrate adherence to the Party leadership, the status of people as masters, and the governance of the State by law. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Second, in initiating work, we should closely embrace the overall plan of the Party and the State, closely embrace the major issues of reform, development, and stability, and closely embrace hot and tough issues that are of general concern to the people, so as to continuously enhance the actual effects of NPC work. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Third, we should put forth the special features and advantages of NPC work, adhere to centralized democracy, carry out tasks in strict accordance with laws and procedures, and decide on issues collectively. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Chinese Experts: US Playing up "China Military Threat" is Groundless Accusation </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 9 (Correspondents Li Xuanliang, Xiong Zhengyan, and Lin Liping) In the Quadrennial Defense Review that the US Pentagon has officially submitted to Congress recently, China was for the first time called "an emerging power that has the greatest potential to militarily challenge the United States." </seg>
<seg id="3"> Experts think this is a groundless accusation against China's normal national defense construction.  It plays up "China military threat" and interferes in China's internal affairs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The Quadrennial Defense Review is the Pentagon's new national defense guideline document. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The 92-page-long report devoted three paragraphs to commenting on China's military issues and the countermeasures the United States should take.  Directly mentioning the two phrases of "China" or "Chinese" 15 times, the report said that "as a major and emerging power, China has the greatest potential to compete militarily with the United States.  If the United States does not have countermeasures, China will very likely develop disruptive military technologies so as to destroy US advantages in conventional weapons." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Yao Yunzhu, a research fellow from the department of world military studies of the Chinese Military Academy of Sciences, said that though senior US officials expressed similar views on various occasions earlier, this is the first time the United States proposed in its "national defense strategy report" that "China is an emerging power that has the greatest potential to militarily challenge the United States." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "The report for the first time explicitly refers to Russia, India and China as emerging strategic rivals; in particular, more attention was given to the so-called 'China military threat,'" </seg>
<seg id="8"> said Major General Peng Guangqian, a research fellow with the Chinese Military Academy of Sciences. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Noticeably, on the same day the Quadrennial Defense Review was officially submitted, US President Bush also submitted a government budget for the 2007 fiscal year to Congress, with the national defense budget at 439.3 billion US dollars. </seg>
<seg id="10"> "If the additional budget for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan is added, the US national defense budget for 2007 fiscal year will go beyond the milestone of 500 billion dollars, an all time high," Peng Guangqian said. "That is almost equal to the sum of the military spending of all the other countries in the world." </seg>

<p>
<seg id="11"> Peng Guanqian thinks that the fabrication of "foreign threats" by the United States reflected the Pentagon's habitual style of "making enemies" and that its real purpose is to secure more national defense funds so that the huge US arms industry groups can fish for more profits. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Experts said that compared with huge military expenditures of the United States, China's national defense expenditures are quite limited. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Deng Hongzhou, a military expert who has participated several times in drafting the white papers on China's national defense, said that China's defense expenditures have somewhat increased with economic development since the 1990s, but the proportion it takes in the State national budget for the same period is on the decline. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Official statistics show that compared with 1979, the proportion of China's expenditures for national defense in 2004 in the State budget for the same period dropped by nearly 10 percentage points. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In 2005 China's expenditures for national defense was 244.656 billion RMB, only about 1/14 of that of the United States.  Its military expenditure per capita was about 1/60 of that of the United States, and its military funding per soldier was about 1/30 of that of a US soldier. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "The United States is equal to China in terms of territorial area, but there is such a big difference in military expenditures.  It is self-evident whose military power is beyond normal defense needs." </seg>
<seg id="17"> Peng Guangqian said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Teng Jianqun, director of the research department of the China Arms Control and Disarmament Association, said that the United States should evaluate China's military construction situation objectively and that China's peaceful development doesn't necessarily mean that China and the United States will become military antagonists in the future. </seg>
<seg id="19"> China's 2004 white paper on national defense says that China firmly adheres to the path of peaceful development and adopts a national defense policy that is defensive in nature. </seg>
<seg id="20"> China has never threatened any country in the past and at present, and will never do so in the future. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> So far China has not set up any military base in any other country, nor has China dispatched a single soldier to other countries.  In contrast, the United States has established more than 100 military bases overseas and has deployed more than 100,000 soldiers in Asia alone. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Zhu Feng, a professor of the International Relations Institute of Peking University, said that China and the United States should increase communication and exchange through established channels and enhance understanding and mutual trust so as to fully push forward the China-US constructive cooperation in the new century and jointly promote and safeguard world peace and development. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Ram Allah, Feb. 9 (International Observation) Hamas Seeks Breakthrough in Forming Cabinet </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Xinhua News Agency Correspondents Wang Hao and Huang Min </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> After the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) won the Legislative Council elections, how to draw up a blueprint for a new government has become the current focus of international attention. </seg>
<seg id="5"> What new policies Hamas will push for will directly impact the direction of subsequent corresponding policies by the various parties to the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In the meantime, resistance by the US and Israel will add to the uncertainty about the prospects of the Hamas government. </seg>
<seg id="7"> At present, various parties in Palestine are accelerating consultations and actively seeking breakthroughs on difficulties and sensitive points regarding future developments involved in forming the cabinet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> (Subtitle) Who Will Become Prime Minister? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> After Hamas obtained the right to form the cabinet, some outsiders worried that disagreements could occur between "Prime Minister Hamas" and current top leader Abbas. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In addition, Hamas leader Mashal, who is currently visiting Egypt, stressed that the new Palestinian government led and formed by Hamas will not recognize Israel.  This strong message also increased international concern. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The US and Israel explicitly said that they would not accept a Hamas government which possesses actual power, threatening to discontinue economic aid and tax transfers to Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="12"> However, this did not hinder Hamas from making a flexible tactical adjustment, selecting an independent individual as a compromise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> According to reports, in order to obtain maximum international recognition, Hamas leaders both at home and abroad, who recently gathered in Egypt, decided to select independent Jamal al-Khudairi, board chairman of the Islamic University in Gaza, as new prime minister. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The move has yet to receive responses from relevant parties. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Palestinian analyst Hussein said that no matter who becomes prime minister, the key is that the prime minister nominee should try to downplay the hard-line stance of Hamas.  Only in this way can success in forming a cabinet be ensured. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> (Subtitle) How to Divide Power? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Internally, the biggest challenge Hamas faces in forming a cabinet is its lack of sufficient experience in governance. </seg>
<seg id="18"> An article carried in the Palestinian newspaper Al-Ayyam analyzed that although Hamas won popularity through its social welfare programs, it lacks experience in governance.  It would be wise for it to cooperate with the Palestinian National Liberation Movement (Fatah), which has experience in governance. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Following the elections, Hamas proposed establishing a "political partnership" with Fatah so as to jointly form a national coalition government.  However, Fatah has not responded enthusiastically so far. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Fatah is currently divided internally with regards to joining the cabinet.  One faction advocates joining the new government so as to make some kind of move, while another faction rejects the Hamas invitation, preferring to be an "active opposition" in the Legislative Council. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Sources noted that under Abbas's persuasion, Fatah is gradually leaning toward joining the new government. </seg>
<seg id="22"> In spite of this, Hamas and Fatah will still bargain over the distribution of cabinet positions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> In addition, another approach is to form a cabinet outside the framework of the Legislative Council, breaking away from partisan affiliations. </seg>
<seg id="24"> According to reports, Hamas has designed a government exclusively composed of experts, but the specific name list is unknown. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Based on US and Israeli attitudes, forming a government composed of technical experts would also be a good way to relieve outside pressure. </seg>
<seg id="26"> According to the provisions of the Palestinian Basic Law, after the new Legislative Council assumes power on the 16th of this month, the nomination of the prime minister and formation of the cabinet will be completed within three to five weeks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> (Subtitle) What About Arms? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The weapons it possesses is another tough issue Hamas faces in forming the new government. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The US and Israel are very firm in their positions, resolutely demanding that Hamas abandon violence and rejecting its armed participation in the government. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Hamas leader Mashal stressed on the 9th that armed resistance is a "strategic choice" of the organization. </seg>
<seg id="31"> The issue of weapons actually exists on two levels, the legitimacy of arms and the affiliation and administration of armed forces. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Hamas won international recognition by being elected the top major party in the Legislative Council through democratic and free methods.  The way to similarly legalize its subordinate armed faction Az A-Din Al-Qassam Brigades is to integrate it into government security institutions. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Hamas had previously proposed unifying armed forces of all factions into a "People's Army" of the Palestinian National Authority, yet failed to get widespread response and was criticized by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (Jihad). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> At present, Palestine has more than 60,000 security agency personnel, most of whom come from the Fatah camp. </seg>
<seg id="35"> In addition, Fatah has some loosely organized subordinate armed factions, such as al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades and the Fatah Hawks. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Hamas, which is responsible for forming the cabinet, must reach a consensus with Abbas as to how to manage these autonomous armed forces and reasonably divide administrative power. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> According to local media reports, Abbas intends to be in charge of security and intelligence forces, while leaving agencies such as the police and civil defense under the administration of the Interior Ministry of the new government. </seg>
<seg id="38"> However, the various parties are still negotiating over this sensitive issue, with no outcome so far. </seg>

<seg id="1"> China Releases Report on Polar Exploration for First Time </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 10 (Correspondent Li Jianmin)  The State Oceanic Administration has recently released the 2005 Annual Report on China's Polar Exploration.  This is the first time such reports have ever been released since China began its scientific polar expedition activities more than 20 years ago. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The Report gives a comprehensive account of China's polar exploration activities, polar logistics assurance, and major progresses and achievements made in polar scientific research in 2005. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to the records of the Report, at 22:15 on January 9, 2005 (Beijing time), the Chinese Antarctic Inland Icecap Expedition team successfully reached Dome A area, the highest elevation of the Antarctic Inland Icecap, and at 3:15 on January. 18, 2005 (Beijing time) confirmed the highest elevation point of Dome A was 4,093 meters. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> "On the stage of increasingly competitive international polar expedition, the Chinese, relying on their strong willpower and fearless spirit, were courageous to open up new fields and took the lead to challenge the 'peak of the Antarctic Icecap.'  Their single-stroke success realized another dream of human beings in Antarctica." </seg>
<seg id="6"> SOA Director Sun Zhihui said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The Report shows that on March 24, 2005, China's 21st Antarctic expedition team successfully finished its mission and returned to Shanghai.  The expedition lasted 151 days on a journey of 26,500 nautical miles. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On November 18 of the same year, China's 22nd Antarctic expedition team left Shanghai for the Zhongshan Station in Antarctica to carry out scientific exploration, and it will leave the Zhongshan Station for Shanghai by way of Australia before the end of February 2006. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Since it was the first report on polar exploration China released, the 2005 Annual Report on China's Polar Exploration also reviewed and summarized China's polar exploration that started in the early 1980s. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> According to the Report, in 1983, China officially joined the Antarctic Treaty and became a member country of the organization.  In addition, China successively became a member country of a few most influential international organizations on Antarctic affairs, including the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting, the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research, and the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In 1997, China became a member of the International Arctic Science Committee and won a say in and the right to making decisions in international polar affairs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The Report noted that after more than 20 years, China's polar exploration "has taken shape out of nothing and continued to grow in scale," forming a "three stations, one vessel" system on Antarctica and Arctic exploration, namely, the Changcheng Station in the Antarctic established in February 1985 and the Zhongshan Station in the Antarctic established in February 1989, and the Huanghe Station built in July 2004 in the Arctic, as well as the "Xuelong" polar scientific research vessel that was put into operation for Antarctic and Arctic exploration since 1994. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The statistics in the Report show that by the end of 2005, China had organized 22 Antarctic expeditions, two Arctic expeditions based on the "Xuelong" vessel, and another two Arctic expeditions at the Huanghe Station.  To date, more than 3,000 scientific visits have been made by Chinese people nationwide to the Antarctica and Arctic for up close and on-site exploration. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> "We are now carrying out feasibility study of setting up the third Antarctica scientific station and also China's first inland station at the Antarctic." </seg>
<seg id="15"> Sun Zhihui said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "After more than 20 years' endeavors, China has got a niche in polar exploration in the world.  However, compared with other major polar exploration countries, there is still a relatively large gap.  We must catch up with them." </seg>
<seg id="17"> He said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Sun Zhihui disclosed that China will issue a report on polar exploration every year starting this year. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="3"> Fok Kin-ning, Hutchison's Group managing director, said that although "3 Italia" has now received all relevant regulatory approvals required to list, it would be in too much a hurry because the procedures for share subscription must be completed in the next few weeks. </seg>

<seg id="5"> Considering the best interests of shareholders, it has been decided that the IPO be deferred. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> As to when share subscription will start again for the IPO, Fok Kin-ning said it would depend on the future conditions of the European telecommunications market. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Yongon, Feb. 12 (Correspondent Zhang Yunfei) In a special interview with reporters of this agency on the eve of Myanmar Prime Minister Soe Win's visit to China on the 14th, Chinese Ambassador to Myanmar Guan Mu and Commercial Attache Tang Hai said that at present China-Myanmar economic and trade Relations have showed positive momentum of common development featuring rich content, a great variety of forms, and mutual benefit. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Ambassador Guan Mu said that in recent years the neighborly and friendly ties between China and Myanmar, built on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, have been solidified and developed.  Exchange and cooperation in various fields are increasingly expanding and deepening while bilateral economic and trade relations continue to be promoted and strengthened. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Attache Tang Hai said that continued reciprocal visits at high level of the two countries have vigorously promoted the development of the bilateral economic and trade cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="5"> During the bilateral high-level reciprocal visits in 2004, the two sides signed 33 economic and trade cooperation agreement documents.  Most of them are now being implemented and carried out. </seg>
<seg id="6"> He said that it was 1.14 billion US dollars in 2004 and reached 1.209 billion US dollars in 2005.  Of the total, China's exports were 935 million US dollars, while its imports stood at 274 million US dollars. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Of last year's bilateral trade, the total trade volume (including the border trade) between China's Yunnan and Myanmar amounted to 630 million US dollars, up 14.6% over the previous year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Tang Hai said that Myanmar has become one of the major markets for Chinese companies to carry out engineering contract projects.  The main projects China has been contracted to do in Myanmar include power stations, bridges, harbors, and factories (such as sugar plants, textile plants, cement plants, and paper pulp plants), etc. </seg>
<seg id="9"> As Chinese companies carry out their engineering projects in Myanmar, they have also stimulated the export of various sets of mechanical and electronics products by China.  Myanmar has become one of the major markets for China's equipment sets, and mechanical and electronics products. </seg>
<seg id="10"> According to the statistics by China's Customs, in the recent five or six years, the export volume of mechanical and electronics products has accounted for some 45% of China's total exports to Myanmar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Attache Tang also said that Myanmar is rich in natural resources.  Chinese companies have already started to invest in resource development projects in Myanmar's oil, natural gas, nickel and copper mining, etc.  The potential for the development of China-Myanmar economic and trade cooperation is tremendous. </seg>
<seg id="12"> He hopes that Chinese companies will have a long-term vision, learn to avoid risks, and make careful decisions.  They should set up a good corporate image and win honor to their country by ensuring the quality and timely completion of their awarded contract projects. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Ambassador Guan Mu and Attache Tang Hai both think that Prime Minister Soe Win's upcoming official visit to China, a major event in bilateral relations this year, will be of great significance in increasing mutual political trust, promoting bilateral cooperation, and pushing for further development of neighborly and friendly ties between China and Myanmar. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, Feb. 13 (Correspondent Qian Zheng) Researchers at Japan's Tokai University have developed a type of bio-artificial kidney, which not only has the same catabolic functions as a human kidney, but also the function of preserving useful substances.  In addition it is small in size and easy to transplant.  With further research, there is hope it will bring good news to kidney patients. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> According to a recent Nikkei Business Daily report, the newly-developed bio-artificial kidney mainly consists of two parts, an artificial nephron that filters metabolic waste and water from the blood and an artificial renal tubule that returns to the blood the useful ingredients in primary urine, such as water and amino acids. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Both the "artificial nephron" and the "artificial renal tubule" are made of hollow fibers.  In addition, the interior of the artificial renal tubule is fully lined with renal tubular epithelial cells which have the ability to decompose metabolic waste. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The epithelial cells can decompose the causative substance of dialysis-related amyloidosis, a disease caused by repeated hemodialysis, into amino acids and return them to the blood while reabsorbing into the blood the glucose, vitamins, and minerals the body needs. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In contrast, previous artificial kidneys, depending on the difference of osmotic pressures to filter metabolic waste, were unable to remove that completely and nor did they have the ability to return ingredients such as amino acids to the blood. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Researchers tested the bio-artificial kidney transplant on goats, using a pig's epithelial cells to line the interior of the hollow fibers of the artificial kidney. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Two weeks later, researchers confirmed that the artificial kidney had been able to function. </seg>
<seg id="9"> They are presently developing a bio-artificial kidney using human renal cells and will start clinical studies after testing its safety. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Safe Power Production in China Still Faces Serious Challenges </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 13 (Correspondent An Bei) A senior official from the State Electricity Regulatory Commission said on the 13th that although power production safety remained generally stable in 2005, safe power production still faces serious challenges. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> At the fifth (expanded) meeting of the National Commission for Safe Power Production held here, SERC Vice Chairman Shi Yubo said that in 2005 China's power production safety was generally stable, while power supply during the peak summer season was successfully and safely accomplished.  Active efforts were made to cope with the effects of natural disasters, and the safe and stable operation of the power supply system was basically ensured.  Accidents involving power production safety infrastructure as well as general power grid accidents were significantly reduced on a year-on-year basis, and the physical condition of power supply infrastructure was improved. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Nevertheless, he noted that along with changes in the power supply and demand situation and the operation of a large number of newly-built power generator units added in succession, safe power production will face new challenges. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Included in these challenges are: regional, seasonal, and periodic power shortages will continue to exist; the power supply and demand situation in some regions will remain quite tight; the lack of a good mechanism for coal pricing for power generation will continue to result in relatively big coal supply problems, while at the same time, the lack of effective control over the declining quality of coal will produce serious impact on the stable operation of power generator units; some weakly structured parts of power grids and outdated equipment may pose hidden hazards to the safety of the system; and the frequency of accidents in power infrastructure construction has yet to be brought under control, with the situation remaining grim. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Shi Yubo said that with the deepening of electricity system reform, many contradictions at deep levels will continue to emerge.  How to maintain a stable working staff and ensure normal production order will become new problems. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> With regard to power production safety work in 2006, Shi Yubo said that efforts should be made to further strengthen the basic administration of power production safety; accelerate the establishment and improvement of administrative mechanisms for power safety emergencies; enhance capabilities for handling emergencies; step up coordination and cooperation among power producers and power grids so as to jointly maintain power system safety; continue to effectively supervise dam safety for hydro-electric power stations and to work on developing information networks to ensure dam safety; strengthen safety supervision in power infrastructure construction to reduce accidents resulting in casualties; and continue to enhance information reporting and notification to ensure the accurate and timely flow of power safety information. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> It was learned that in connection with the new power safety administration situation, this year the SERC will carry out revision and improvement of the Provisional Regulations on Investigation of Power Production Accidents that were issued.  Meanwhile, supplementary documents concerning dam safety for hydro-electric power stations and protection of secondary power systems will be released in succession for implementation this year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> In 2005, electricity consumption by all sectors in China reached 2,468.9 gigawatt-hours, up 13.45% year-on-year. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Faced with adverse situations such as tightening power supply and demand, and increasing problems with coal, electricity, and oil transportation, various power producers took effective measures, stepping up management of infrastructure.  In all of last year, throughout the country, no exceptionally large infrastructure accidents occurred in power production. </seg>
<seg id="11"> There were 74 grid accidents, down 127 cases year-on-year, and 427 infrastructure accidents, down 132 cases year-on-year. </seg>

<seg id="1"> South African Minister Plenipotentiary in China Says No "Organized" Crimes against Chinese Citizens in South Africa </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 13 (Correspondents Wang Jiangang and Hao Yalin) Minister Plenipotentiary Vusi B. Koloane, charge d'affaires ad interim of the South African embassy in China, said in an exclusive Xinhua interview on the 13th that there are no "organized" crimes against Chinese citizens in South Africa. </seg>
<seg id="3"> At the same time, he said that the South African government will try its best to "crack down on all forms of criminal activity." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Vusi B. Koloane said that the South African government hopes to "reduce to zero" the crime rate and hopes that the life and property of every foreign national working in South Africa will be fully protected by the local law and citizens. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Since 2006, four Chinese citizens have already been killed one after another in South Africa.  Chinese communities have shown widespread concern about this. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In response to this, the Chinese Foreign Ministry has made representations to South Africa and also reminded Chinese citizens in South Africa to further step up vigilance, enhance unity and friendship among Chinese compatriots, and cooperate with police to jointly combat crime activities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "We express our sincerest sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims." </seg>
<seg id="8"> Vusi B. Koloane said: "We apologize for this and assure the Chinese people that the South African government is earnestly investigating every single case involving Chinese nationals." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> According to the Chinese embassy in South Africa, South African police have successfully cracked the February 5 case in which Chen Jianqing, a Chinese woman from Fujian, China, was killed in South Africa.  A suspect has been arrested. </seg>
<seg id="10"> At present police are after another suspect. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Also, according to the disclosure by the South African embassy in China, the criminal involved in the shooting of a Hong Kong businessman in January of this year has been arrested by South African police, with the property of the victim recovered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Speaking of the impact that these incidents of Chinese citizens being killed may have, Vusi B. Koloane thinks that the incidents "indeed" will have some negative impact on exchanges in trade, tourism, and other fields between the two countries, but the impact "should be fairly small" in the long run. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> According to the briefing by Nyembezi, tourism attache of the South African embassy, the embassy issued more than 2,000 visas to Chinese nationals going to South Africa in the first 15 days alone of this year. </seg>
<seg id="14"> In addition, according to the Chinese official statistics, South Africa continued to maintain its position as China's largest trade partner in Africa in 2005. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The bilateral trade volume reached 7.27 billion US dollars, growing 23% year-on-year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> However, tourism professionals think that the serial killings of Chinese citizens in 2004 have significantly affected the number of Chinese tourists to South Africa. </seg>
<seg id="17"> According to the statistics of South Africa's tourism bureau, the number of Chinese tourists to South Africa in the first half of 2005 was 20,331, a 14.9% year-on-year decrease. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Currently, some 200,000 Chinese nationals live in towns and rural areas across South Africa. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Analysts here attribute the high crime rate to the large gap between the rich and the poor, high unemployment rate, rampant use of guns, and lack of death penalty in South Africa. </seg>
<seg id="20"> As many Chinese nationals do not understand English and have cash with them or in their homes, they are more likely to become targets of attack by criminals seeking their money. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 14 (Correspondent Meng Na) While answering foreign correspondents' questions at a press conference held by the Ministry of Public Security on the 14th, Zheng Baigang, deputy director of the Ministry's supervision department, pointed out that the so-called "use of inappropriate methods to make criminal suspects confess" is absolutely prohibited in China. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In addition, preventing such problems from happening is a major focus of work for the supervision department. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> He also noted that some international organizations do not have a comprehensive and correct understanding of the situation of law enforcement by Chinese police. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The latest data provided by the Ministry of Public Security on the 14th reveal that in 2002 and 2004 the Ministry of Public Security successively issued the Provisions on the Implementation of Detention Measures and Record-keeping by Public Security Organs and the Provisions on Application of Further Interrogation by Public Security Organs, which have more effectively ensured that grass-roots public security organs carry out detention and interrogation measures in accordance with applicable laws. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Since 1997, in order to further push for the "three rectifications" (namely, rectify the extraction of confessions by torture, rectify the abuse of arms and police equipment, and rectify the abuse of coercive measures) police supervisory personnel of public security organs nationwide have been persistently making open and secret trips to grass-roots and frontline law enforcement units such as police stations, criminal police teams, police patrol teams, traffic police teams, venues under the surveillance of public security organs, as well as scenes of law enforcement, to observe components of law enforcement involving citizens' personal safety rights, to check for holes and remedy oversights, to give warnings and reminders, and to stop wrongdoings at the outset. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In order to prevent law enforcement problems where they originate, police supervisory departments have further broadened the scope of law enforcement supervision and stepped up supervision and inspection of components of law enforcement, such as the application of subpoena measures, inquiries and interrogations, 110 police call processing, statistics on case filings, disposal of assets involved in cases, security officers who ticket fines and penalties, and data recording of automobile thefts and robberies. </seg>

As of the noon this day, hundreds of people have come to pay their respects. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Some time after 8:00 a.m., a long line of dozens of people formed outside the door before the opening time of the mourning hall. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Inside the mourning hall at PKU's Centennial Hall, this reporter saw a black banner hanging from the wall of the hall which read "Deep Condolences for Academician Wang Xuan." </seg>
<seg id="5"> Beneath the banner was a huge 10-plus square meter portrait of Wang Xuan.  Wearing a pair of glasses, he looked scholarly with a gentle smile on his face. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The portrait was flanked by several cypress trees and dozens of wreaths. </seg>
<seg id="7"> One of the wreaths had this elegiac couplet: "Originated in the Qin, thriving in the Tang, a good foundation was laid in China; bidding farewell to lead type, ushering in electronic type, the modern Bi Sheng drew up the blueprint." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The mourning hall was ensconced in funereal music in a solemn and heavy atmosphere. </seg>

<seg id="10"> Some of them held fresh flowers in their arms, while some carried flower baskets.  All had small white flowers pinned on their chests.  Slowly they walked up to the portrait of academician Wang Xuan and bowed to express their condolences. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Many people could not hold back tears. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Zhang Wenbin, former director of the State Administration of Cultural Heritage and a PKU alumnus, told reporters that more than ten years ago, when he was still working in Henan Province, he once invited Professor Wang Xuan to give a report on scientific and technological innovation to provincial Party committee cadres. </seg>

<seg id="21"> "At first he insisted on not applying for the title of academician.  It was only after Mr. Zhou Peiyuan's repeated pleas that he filled out the form." </seg>

<seg id="23"> Mr. Jin said that Wang Xuan started to focus on mentoring young people when he was in his 50s.  He constantly stressed that he wanted to pave the way for young people and that he wanted to be their stepping stone. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 15 (Correspondents Zhou Wei and Li Fei) At present, many websites rely on republishing large quantities of news reports from newspapers and magazines to increase their hit rates, but many are not authorized to do so and have not paid any fees.  In response to this, Wang Ziqiang, director of the copyright division of the National Copyright Administration, said at a press conference held by the Information Office of the State Council on the 15th that regarding the issue of paying for republishing works online, the Information Network Publishing Rights Protection Rules to be issued by the State Council will provide the answers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Wang Ziqiang said that according to the provisions of the current law, as long as authors do not make a statement prohibiting use, newspapers and magazines can use works already published in newspapers and magazines without the consent of authors while paying compensation.  The National Copyright Administration has specifically set forth the compensation standards for republishing by newspapers and magazines in accordance with the provisions of the law. </seg>
<seg id="4"> However, according to the provisions of the current law, newspaper and magazine publishers have this legal right while no such legal permission is given to the internet at this time. </seg>
<seg id="5"> According to the relevant legal interpretation given by the Supreme People's Court, the legal permission to republish given to newspapers and magazines can be applied to the internet, that is, as long as authors do not make a statement prohibiting use, small articles published in newspapers, magazines, and on the internet can be used online without permission while compensations are made. </seg>
<seg id="6"> However, since the legal interpretation does not stipulate the compensation standards, in reality such works are used on the internet without being given any compensations. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, Feb. 16 (Correspondent Zhou Liquan) After a massive fire disaster occurred in the Central Hospital of Liaoyuan City, Jilin Province, the accident investigation team ascertained 11 culprits, among whom, four people including Zhang Diankun, head of the hospital electrician team, and others will be indicted with charges of causing a major accident due to negligence. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> On December 15, 2005, a fire disaster broke out in the Central Hospital, the largest hospital in Liaoyuan City, leaving 39 people dead in the end. </seg>
<seg id="4"> An area of over 5,000 square meters was burnt during this fire disaster. </seg>
<seg id="5"> It was learned that this is the largest fire accident in the medical and health system nationwide since the founding of new China. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> According to the investigation, at about 16:30 on the day of the accident, there was a sudden power outage in the Central Hospital of Liaoyuan City.  According to the design of electrical circuit for the hospital, if there was a power outage, the switch of the transformer would be automatically switched to the secondary switch so as to continue providing normal power supply for the hospital.  However, the switch did not make the automatic switch at the time, yet the electrician team leader Zhang Diankun forced the power back on without checking the cause of the power outage, causing the fire disaster. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In addition, more than ten underground cables from which smoke started to rise were tangled together in disorder when such cables should have been neatly and evenly laid out and protected with a fire shield. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> As a result, three people, 57-year-old Zhao Yongchun, head of the electrical installation team of the Liaoyuan City Textile Company, Sun Fenglin, retired cadre (senior engineer) from the Liaoyuan Electricity Bureau, and Jin Chengtai, a rehired retiree from the Central Hospital of Liaoyuan City, will also be indicted with charges of causing a major accident due to negligence. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 16  The Central Organization Department recently issued Suggestions for Strengthening Supervision of Cadres. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The Suggestions call on all levels of the Organization Department to supervise cadres in the various components of training, education, inspection, examination, selection, appointment, and day-to-day management, on the basis of strict administration and benevolent protection of cadres.  They should establish to perfection supervisory working mechanism that emphasizes prevention, timely detection, and serious rectification, so as to effectively strengthen supervision over selection and appointment of leading cadres and cadres overall. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> With regard to supervision of leadership teams and leading cadres, the Suggestions propose that education on ideals and beliefs, as well as anti-corruption and promotion of integrity, should be persistently carried out.  Such education should be incorporated into the training, selection, management, and supervision of cadres so as to guide and urge leading cadres to enhance cultivation of Party spirit, adhere to the Party's principle of serving public interests and people's welfare, and build up a strong ideological line of defense against corruption and degeneration. </seg>

<seg id="7"> Leadership teams at all levels should be urged to adhere to democratic centralism and to establish and perfect administrative and decision making rules and procedures, so as to earnestly implement a system of collective leadership combined with individual responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Emphasis should be placed on supervision of chief officials of leadership teams.

<seg id="9"> Establish to perfection a day-to-day supervisory system for leading cadres, periodically engage in learning and analysis about the circumstances of ideologies and styles of leading cadres, and propose problem-solving suggestions and measures. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Implement a system of warning discussions and inquiry letters for leading cadres, and engage in timely warning discussions or letters of inquiry once signs of trouble are detected. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Earnestly investigate prominent problems involving leading cadres reported by ordinary people.  If problems truly exist, criticism, education, or corresponding organizational disciplinary action should be carried out, depending on individual cases.  Violators of regulations and laws should be turned over to law enforcement organs.  If investigations confirm there have been problems, appropriate methods should be taken to clean things up. </seg>
<seg id="12"> At the same time, integrate strengthening supervision with encouraging cadres to engage in bold exploration and innovation, while paying attention to discovering and praising exemplary cadres. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The Suggestions call on the Organization (personnel) Department at all levels to effectively strengthen supervision of the selection and appointment of Party and government leading cadres. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Further improve supervisory measures concerning components of cadre work such as recommendations, examinations, consultations, discussions, and decisions.  Strictly safeguard the process of personnel selection and appointment, and provide firm assurance that cadres who are politically reliable, professionally competent, impeccable in style, and worthy of public trust are selected and appointed for leading positions at various levels. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Strengthen inspection of the implementation of the cadre appointment regulations, seriously investigate and punish violations of the cadre appointment regulations, and firmly prevent inappropriate practices and corruption involving personnel appointments. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Implement a case-based supervisory and investigative system regarding serious violations of personnel appointment regulations to expand supervision and punishment. </seg>

<seg id="21"> The Organization (personnel) Department must strengthen cooperation with discipline inspection organs and establish a communication system, liaison system, and accountability system with discipline inspection organs regarding Party spirit and administrative integrity of cadres, so as to enhance collective supervision. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Earnestly and effectively conduct inspection tours in cooperation with discipline inspection organs, improve inspection tour methods, perfect the inspection tour system, and enhance the quality of inspection tours. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In cooperation with auditing organs, earnestly implement an auditing system regarding financial responsibility of leading cadres. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 16 (Correspondent Chen Jianxing) On the 15th, Taiwan's official economic affairs department decided to fine United Microelectronics Corp. (abbreviated as UMC), one of Taiwan's two giant chipmakers, NT$ 5 million on the grounds of "illegally providing assistance to and participating in the establishment of" mainland-based Hejian Technology Company. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Taiwan's China Times reported that this is the first case of Taiwan authorities fining a Taiwanese business for investing in the mainland since Chen Shui-bian proposed a cross-Strait economic and trade policy advocating "active management and effective opening." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to reports, officials from the "MOEA Investment Commission" said  that UMC was fined because it violated the Statute Governing the Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area and the Regulations Governing the Approval of Investment or Technical Cooperation in Mainland China. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In the future, the "MOEA Investment Commission" will also fine former UMC Chairman Tsao Hsing-cheng and others, depending on the situation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The UMC case originated in February 2005 when Taiwan's prosecution and investigation departments deployed nearly a hundred personnel in raids on the residences and offices of several top UMC officials, claiming that UMC was suspected of illegally "providing funds, technology, and human resources" to Hejian Technology, its mainland investment. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Tsao Hsing-cheng, UMC chairman at the time, subsequently stated publicly that UMC had not violated any regulations of Taiwan authorities and that UMC provided assistance to Hejian Technology in the long-term interest of UMC, since UMC would lose business opportunities if it did not get into the mainland market as soon as possible. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Following that, Taiwan's official Financial Supervisory Commission fined UMC NT$ 3 million on the grounds of violating relevant regulations concerning business information disclosures. </seg>
<seg id="9"> On January 9, 2006, the UMC Board of Directors accepted the resignation of Tsao Hsing-cheng, who a few hours later was officially indicted on suspected illegal investment in the mainland. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> UMC, along with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (abbreviated as TSMC) known as Taiwan's two giant chipmakers, is a leading high-tech corporation on the island. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The series of moves by Taiwan authorities to investigate and punish UMC over the past year have attracted great attention from all sectors of society on the island. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 17 (Correspondent Liu Zheng) With a series of four coalmine accidents each killing more than 100 people, the grim work safety situation throughout the country last year has made "prevention of frequent serous and large-scale coalmine and other accidents" the top priority of work safety efforts nationwide this year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> On the 17th, this reporter learned from SAWS that in order to truly prevent frequent serious and large-scale coalmine and other accidents, coalmines must be the top priority. </seg>
<seg id="4"> With regard to coalmine safety this year, SAWS will effectively carry out the following three tasks: </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> --Continue to effectively tackle the tough issue of controlling methane. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This year "ventilation first, mining second" will be featured in controlling methane. </seg>
<seg id="7"> If coal mines with high concentrations of methane do not implement "ventilation first, mining second," they will be ordered to immediately stop production in accordance with the law. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> --Continue to effectively tackle the tough issue of restructuring and shutting down. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Resolutely and tightly shut down every one of the 5,243 coalmines which have been publicly announced and the other 700-plus coalmines widely reported recently. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Consider shut-downs to be routine work and continuously shut down those coalmines that destroy natural resources, pollute the environment, and do not maintain safety measures. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> --Enhance basic coalmine safety administration. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Promptly rectify and halt administrative declines in a handful of large state-owned coalmines and guide small coalmines with chaotic management to set up standardized safety management systems. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In particular, emphasis should be placed on key state-owned coalmines, absolutely prohibiting production that exceeds capacity, exceeds the intensity threshold, and exceeds the established number of workers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> This year's work safety control targets call for a reduction of the nationwide death toll from various kinds of accidents by 3% from the previous year, with a reduction of 3.5% for coalmines. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The number of large-scale accidents causing more than 10 deaths should be reduced by 5%, with a reduction of 7% for coalmines. </seg>
<seg id="16"> People's governments at the provincial level have all been informed of these control targets, which are being passed down to various levels for implementation at grassroots levels and in companies in all localities. </seg>

<seg id="1"> (Winter Olympics - Stimulants) News Analysis: Pyleva Case Likely to End Where It Is </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Turin, Feb. 17 News Analysis: Pyleva Case Likely to End Where It Is </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Xinhua Correspondents Gao Peng and Ding Ying </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Although Italy has said repeatedly that all athletes found using stimulants during the Turin Winter Olympics may face "prison sentences," based on various circumstances at this time, such fate is unlikely to happen to Russian biathlete Olga Pyleva, the center of the first stimulant scandal at this Winter Olympics. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> On the 16th, the first stimulant scandal broke out at the Turin Winter Olympics when Olga Pyleva was found to have used carphedon, a banned drug. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The next day the International Olympic Committee announced that Pyleva had been expelled from the Winter Olympics.  In addition, she was stripped of the individual biathlon silver medal for women's 15 km event she won at this Winter Olympics. </seg>
<seg id="7"> On the same day, the International Biathlon Union decided to give Pyleva a two-year ban from the competition. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> It has always been the IOC regulation that athletes found using stimulants at the Olympic Games be subject to revocation of their achievements and the eligibility to compete, but they are not subject to legal sanctions. </seg>
<seg id="9"> However, under Italian law, athletes' carrying and using stimulants are considered criminal acts.  Prosecution agencies have the right to directly arrest and investigate athletes on stimulants, and violators also face a prison sentence of between three months and three years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> In December last year, after "bargaining" for a year, the IOC and the Italian government finally reached an agreement, under which the two sides will deal with cases of athletes using stimulants at this Winter Olympics in accordance with the Italian law. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Through the untiring efforts of the IOC, the Italian side made concession four days before the Winter Olympics opened, promising that police would not enter the Olympic village to raid athletes' quarters during the Winter Olympics, but athletes tested positive for drugs are still subject to investigations of Italian prosecutors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Some reports said that Pescante, an Italian government official supervising the Turin Winter Olympics, has already turned over the case of Pyleva using stimulant to Turin's prosecutors. </seg>
<seg id="13"> However, the IOC and Pescante himself so far have not confirmed it yet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Russian biathlon team doctor Andrey Dmytriev disclosed at noon on the 17th that Pyleva has already left Turin for her country. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Shi Kangcheng, a Chinese sports official who formerly worked at the World Anti-Doping Agency for many years, thinks that once Pyleva returns to her country, this incident may eventually "end where it is." </seg>
<seg id="16"> Shi Kangcheng said that the IOC and the Italian government have never "thoroughly resolved" the anti-stimulant issue at the Winter Olympics.  Even if the Italian prosecution agency really gets involved in this case, the outcome is still hard to tell. </seg>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 18  Comprehensive reports by Xinhua correspondents abroad said that bird flu continues to spread further on the African continent. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The WHO confirmed on the 17th that birds that died from infection with bird flu virus have been found in three areas in Egypt. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In Europe, the H5 strain of bird flu virus has also been discovered for the first time in France.  Europe and Africa are on high alert and stepping up epidemic prevention measures. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> WHO Eastern Mediterranean Regional Advisor Hassan Bushra told the news media in Egypt on the 17th that dead birds infected with the H5N1 bird flu virus have been found in three areas of Cairo and Giza in central Egypt, and Minya in the south.  Relevant departments of the Egyptian government have already started to slaughter fowls that are suspected of being infected with bird flu. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Experts noted that as Egypt is an important passageway for migratory birds in the Middle East and North Africa, it is highly likely that migratory birds may bring the bird flu virus to the country. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Egypt has announced a ban on the import of live poultry from abroad and stepped up inspection and quarantine practices at the ports of entry. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In Yaounde, capital of Cameroon, more than 800 chickens on a chicken farm died mysteriously in the past week. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Cameroon has decided to immediately suspend the import of all poultry and pork from Nigeria, where a bird flu epidemic occurred, and put a temporary stop on the trade of poultry and related products on all markets along the border between the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In addition, the government of Cameroon has promptly set up an epidemic monitoring network across the country.  The Pasteur Centre in the country and the State Veterinary Laboratory are on high alert, ready to carry out testing related to the H5N1 virus at any time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> In Europe, Denmark and Sweden preliminarily ruled out the epidemic on the 17th. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The National Veterinary Institute in Sweden released the test results of the dead swans discovered Wednesday, which showed the Swedish swans were not infected with bird flu virus. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The preliminary results of tests by the Danish Veterinary Administration also show that the thirty dead swans recently found within Denmark were not infected with bird flu virus. </seg>
<seg id="14"> However, the agriculture department said that Denmark still cannot afford to be off guard. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Since this year, nine outbreaks of bird flu have occurred in Romania in eastern Europe.  WHO experts said in Bucharest on the 17th that since bird flu broke out in almost all places in the Danube Delta region, the situation must be addressed seriously as Romania may be constantly threatened by bird flu in the next three or five years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> In the Asian country of Bangladesh, the government has taken all necessary preventive measures against bird flu. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The government's Department of Livestock Services has provided relevant books on bird flu prevention to relevant officials and organized domestic fowl breeders for training. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Feb. 18  According to a disclosure by the Blood Center of Zhejiang Province, China's first blood information and data sharing administration and control network system was officially completed and put into operation at the center recently. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> A relevant administrator at the Blood Center of Zhejiang Province said this means that from now on, citizens will be given a unique code after participating in a blood drive with any county (city or district) blood collection/supply agency in Zhejiang Province.  The next time he/she donates blood, just by inputting the relevant code, information such as personal data, blood type, blood donation history, time of the last blood donation, and whether blood can be donated this time will be instantly displayed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The administrator further explained that if, after inputting the code, the system shows an inadequate lapse of time between blood donations, the system will indicate that conditions for blood donation this time have not been met. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This way not only protects blood donors' health but also more effectively protects blood users' health and safety. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In addition, when blood supplies are tight, priority will be given to blood donors and their families for the use of blood.  You just have to input the valid blood donor certificate, and information about the blood donor will instantly appear.  It is extremely convenient. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> According to a report by Hangzhou's Today Morning Express, at present, the information system has been put into use at all 36 blood collection agencies in the province.  Blood resource data at all blood collection/supply agencies across the province have real-time display capability, thereby achieving data sharing throughout the province. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Signs of bird flu virus continue to emerge in Europe and send people into panic. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The Executive Committee of the European Union has passed a resolution for the establishment of additional "buffer area" controls, including all areas of countries where the virus has been discovered for control, and forbidding all trade and transportation of poultries and bird species. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The bird flu breakouts continue to spread to more chicken farms following the eighth day since the deadly H5N1 virus was discovered in Nigeria, Africa, and tracks demonstrate that it has crossed the northern border of Nigeria and entered into Niger. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Egyptian officials are investigating the sudden mass death of chickens on a chicken farm in the south, and there is concern that the virus might continue to spread. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Chicken meat markets in Europe are falling to a great extent because of the impact of the virus event. The Executive Committee of the European Union stressed that there is no reason to panic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Jipu Ruinuo, an executive member of the committee responsible for sanitation and food safety, said that it is understandable for people to be concerned about the event but there is no need for overreaction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The Executive Committee of the European Union has issued a new regulation and listed all of the European areas where the virus has been discovered as "buffer areas" after passing a previous resolution about the establishment of a three-kilometer protection area and ten-kilometer warning area around every virus discovery spot. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> An official for the European Union, who preferred to remain anonymous, pointed out that everyone is very nervous, and processing news from everywhere in Europe about suspicions of breakouts of the epidemic. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="12"> On the 16th, Romania discovered its 31st epidemic case, and Slovenia, Austria, Greece, and Ruegen Island in Germany have also discovered new epidemic cases. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The bird flu virus was discovered in the bodies of two ducks in southern Italy, which are the first poultry infected with the H5N1 virus in the European region, aside from wild swans. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The greatest concern that European Union officials have is those migrant birds that will be flying back from Africa. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The Nigerian government is strengthening its work to prevent the human infection of the virus on the African continent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The Nigerian government announced that all poultries and bird species must be destroyed within a five-kilometer area of where an infected farm is discovered, regardless of whether they are threatened by the virus or not. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 6 (reporter: Han Jie and Xu Bo) Reporters learned from China's Banking Supervision Committee on the 6th that the "Electronic Banking Business Management Method" and the "Guidance on Electronic Banks Security Assessment" issued by the Banking Supervision Committee in recent days will be implemented on March 1, 2006. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> A spokesman for the Banking Supervision Committee said that based on the management method regulations, the approval method for foreign financial institutions is unchanged, i.e. if a branch of a foreign bank is approved to establish an online banking business and it needs to add a new service item for the online banking business, the major unit that reports to the branch in China's territory should be solely responsible for the application and review. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> To normalize banking business development of commercial banks that use the Internet, the Chinese People's Bank has made and issued the "Temporary Method for Management of Online Banking Businesses" in June, 2001. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The spokesman for the Banking Supervision Committee said that with the continuous development of electronic banking business at commercial banks, the Temporary Method cannot meet the requirements for electronic banking risk control anymore. Thus, the Banking Supervision Committee has made two new regulations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> As the spokesman for the Banking Supervision Committee introduced, the acknowledgement of the Banking Supervision Committee on qualification of a security assessment setup is different from industrial admission or administrative approval for admission qualification for enterprises, and it is not a necessary condition for an assessment setup to conduct its security assessment business for electronic banking, and it is only a reference when financial institutions select an assessment setup. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> As long as a security assessment setup follows related conditions and requirements, even if it is not acknowledged by the Banking Supervision Committee for its qualification, financial institutions can still invite it to conduct an assessment for electronic banking security, but it should be controlled according to related regulations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The "Method for Management of Electronic Banking Businesses" has a total of nine chapters and 99 articles that are divided into nine parts, including the General Principle, Application and Renewal, Risk Control, Data Exchange and Transfer Control, Business Contract Control, Cross-Border Business Activities Control, Supervision Control, Liabilities, and Additional Regulations, etc. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The "Guidance on Electronic Banks Security Assessment" has a total of five chapters and 57 articles that are divided into five parts, including the General Principle, Security Assessment Setup, Implementation of Security Assessment, Management of Security Assessment Activities, and Additional Regulations, etc. </seg>

<seg id="1"> (Newspaper Digest) Part-Time Workers and High School Graduates Become Major Forces of Hourly-Paid Work in Shanghai </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 7. The "Guidance on the Current Standard for Hourly-Paid Wages in 2006" issued by the Labor and Social Support Bureau of Shanghai City on February 6, lists 120 occupations, which is 11 more than the number issued last time. The "wage levels" of the original positions are either increased or reduced. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> As an estimate made by related experts of the Labor and Social Support Bureau of Shanghai City, currently the hourly-paid workers in Shanghai are more than one million. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> As China Youth Journal reported, part-time workers and high school graduates are the major part of the team of hourly-paid labors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Through a direct survey of more than 8,000 hourly-paid workers, more than half of them are part-time workers, and their ratio is 51.1%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Those part-time workers are generally well educated, and mainly do more technical work. For instance, the ratio of part-time workers in the translation occupation is as high as 81.7%, and that in the gym business is 61.6%. </seg>
<seg id="7"> High income is one of the important reasons for many people to work at hourly-paid part-time jobs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> As was learned, monthly income for some positions can reach up to several tens of thousands of Yuan, and it is difficult to find high-demand talents, such as simultaneous interpreters; most hourly-paid workers' monthly incomes can reach more than 2,000 Yuan, such as part-time financial workers, wedding ceremony managers, etc. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> One of the important reasons for the popularity of part-time workers for hourly wages is that those jobs suit individual interests and workers can learn more knowledge from those jobs. </seg>
<seg id="10"> For instance, Mr. Gu, who is a manager of the Human Resources Unit at a company, uses several hours to handle business accounts for a foreign business agency every week. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Mr. Gu thinks that the greatest benefit of a part-time job is to continuously renew his own knowledge, and has opportunities to know another field, and of course, a monthly income of 2,000 Yuan is also attractive to a certain extent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Since some positions for hourly-paid workers are low-skill ones, and their working patterns are flexible and free, they have gradually become popular among a lot of graduates who are looking for jobs. 14% of hourly-paid workers are graduates from colleges and polytechnic schools in the last three years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> "I did not want to do an hourly-paid job in the beginning. But several months later, I feel it is better than 9 to 5 work." </seg>
<seg id="14"> Xiao Huang's job hunting is not that satisfying after he graduates from college. He eventually registers with a hotel and plays background music on a piano. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "I am quite satisfied with my current work, 100 yuan per hour, and the environment is also good. What I should do now is to find several more hourly-paid jobs." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> As has been learned, hourly-paid jobs have become an important path for those graduates who are looking for jobs to accumulate work experience, exercise their work skills, improve their communication skills, and enrich their social experience. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Those graduates who work at hourly-paid jobs are mainly concentrated in positions that require more knowledge and skills, including translation positions, which require professional skills, and entertainment and performance positions, which require current popularity. These two kinds of positions are 22.1% and 26.8%, respectively, among those jobs that require more knowledge and skills. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Some positions for hourly-paid workers do not require high skills, such as food promotion workers, merchandise handlers, and unemployed workers who are able to work through simple trainings. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Data shows that those hourly-paid workers who used to be unemployed are 39% of the total hourly-paid workers; among them, workers who used to work in retail business are 68.4%; and those in restaurants and food businesses are 58.7%. The hourly-paid jobs have become an important channel for unemployed workers to find their employment. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Wu Bangguo stressed that China has entered the historical phase in which she must rely more on strengthening her self-innovative capability and promoting labor qualities to advance economic and social developments, and that only if scientific and technological progress and innovations are vigorously advanced can quality of productivity be greatly improved, and economic and social developments actually be turned to a path of scientific development. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It should establish and perfect systems and mechanisms that are good for innovations as soon as possible, enhance science and technology investment, encourage patents and inventions, develop well-known brands, accelerate the transformation from scientific and technological accomplishments to realization of productivity, strengthen enterprises' autonomy in their own innovations, and continuously promote the contribution rate of scientific and technological developments in economic growth. </seg>

<seg id="11"> It should cultivate innovative awareness in the entire society, vigorously advocate an innovative and competitive spirit, and focus on creating a good atmosphere for cultivation of talents. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Wu Bangguo pointed out that the People's Congress is playing more important roles in the process of administration of the nation with laws and construction of the socialist country with legal systems. </seg>
<seg id="13"> For the People's Congress to do a good job in the new situation, the first thing should be to stick to a correct political direction, firmly walk on the developmental path of socialist politics with Chinese features, and organically integrate staying with the leadership of the Party, people being in charge, and governing the country according to laws. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The second thing should be to focus on the major work of the party and state, important issues in reforms and developments, and working on hot and difficult issues that the masses of people care about, and continuously strengthen the efficiency of the work of the People's Congress. </seg>

<seg id="1"> China Comes Up With an "Important Science and Research Plan" for Future 15 Years </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 9 (reporter: Li Xing) To promote China's international competitive capacity, vigorously advance sustainable development, and realize a prioritized plan for surpassing (developed countries), the "Outline Plan for the State's Medium- and Long-Term Scientific and Technological Development (2006 to 2020)," issued by the State Council on the 9th, has arranged four important plans for scientific studies. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The four important scientific plans include protein studies, quantum adjustment and control studies, nano-studies, and growth and reproduction studies. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The outline points out that protein science is the peak of life science that developed countries are fiercely competing for. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In the next 15 years, China should focus on studying transcription repression histochemistry, protein histochemistry, metabolic histochemistry, structural biology, functions and interactions of protein biology, biology and systematic biology regarding protein calculation, methodology of protein studies and related application and basic studies, etc. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> At the same time, the outline thinks that quantum adjustment and control studies has an obvious forward-looking nature, and might significantly impact the economic development of human society to an extent that can hardly be assessed in 20 to 30 years. </seg>
<seg id="7"> China should focus on studying the carrier, adjustment, and control rationales and methods of quantum communication, quantum calculation, the new quantum effect of constrained small quantum systems, quantum adjustment and control demonstration, and a new rationale and technical basis for quantum measurement, etc. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Moreover, the outline points out that nano-technology has become the strategic selection for many countries to promote their core competitive capacity, and also is one of the fields for China to realize its surpassing development. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In the next 15 years, China will focus on studying in this field, including controllable equipment, self-assembly, and functionalization of nano-material, nano-electronics, nano-biology, nano-medicine, nano-size demonstration and metrology, and applications of nano-material and technology in fields such as energy, the environment, information, medicine, etc. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Since China's population is growing on a large scale, there are many birth defects, a serious shortage of organs for transplants, and the aging peak is coming, it urgently needs to make breakthroughs and technological innovations in the scientific theories on reproduction and development. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Based on the outline, from 2006 to 2020, China will focus on studying stem cell reproduction, differentiation, adjustment, and control; production, maturity, and fertilization of reproductive cells; the mechanism of declination and degenerative pathological changes in human reproductive functions; and the safety and ethics of assisting reproduction of stem cells, and stem cell technology, etc. </seg>

<seg id="1"> China's Experts: "China's Military Threat" Touted by the United States Is an Unreasonable Accusation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 9 (reporters: Li Xuanliang, Xiong Zhengyan, Lin Liping). The Quadrennial Defense Review formally submitted by the United States Pentagon to the Congress a few days ago first calls China "a newly arisen power that is most likely to challenge the United States militarily." </seg>
<seg id="3"> Experts think that this is an unreasonable accusation against China's normal defense construction, and an interference in China's internal affairs by exaggerating the "theory of China's military threat." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The Quadrennial Defense Review is a new guidance document for national defense of the Pentagon. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This 92-page report uses three paragraphs to discuss the issue of China's military strength and how the United States should cope with it. The report directly mentions the two terms of "China" and "Chinese" 15 times, and says that, "As a major newly arisen power, China has the most military potential to compete with the United States; if the United States does not take any countermeasures, China is very likely to develop destructive military technology, and break the US supremacy of traditional weapons." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Yao Yunzhu, a research fellow at the World's Military Study Office of China's Military Science Academy, said that although senior US officials expressed similar views before, this is the first time for the United States to come up with the idea that "China is most likely to challenge the United States militarily as a newly arisen power" in a Defense Strategy Report. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "This report first regards Russia, India, and China as newly arisen strategic rivals, and especially, pays more attention to the so-called 'theory of China's military threat,'" </seg>
<seg id="8"> said Major General Peng Guangqian, a research fellow at China's Military Science Academy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The noticeable thing is that on the same day when The Quadrennial Defense Review was submitted, US President Bush also presented his administrative budget for the 2007 fiscal year to the Congress, and the defense budget is as high as 439.3 billion dollars in the budget. </seg>
<seg id="10"> "If the budget for military activities in Iraq and Afghanistan is added, the defense budget for the US in the 2007 fiscal year will break the historical record of 500 billion dollars," said Peng Guangqian. "And this almost amounts to the sum of military expenses of all the countries in the world." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Peng Guangqian thinks that the US method of making "theories of threats from other countries" reflects its consistent style of "making enemies," and its real goal is to strive for more defense funds and fish for more profits for the US's gigantic defense industry groups. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Experts said that compared with the large military expenses of the US, China's military expenditure is quite limited. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Deng Hongzhou, a military expert who has participated in the writing of the China Defense White Paper many times, said that since the 90s of the 20th century, with the economic development, China's defense funding has been increased to some extent, but it tends to fall in its ratio to the state's financial expenditure in the same periods. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Official data shows that comparing 2004 with 1979, the ratio of China's defense expenditure in the state's financial expenditure was decreased nearly 10 percentage points. </seg>
<seg id="15"> China's defense funding in 2005 was RMB 244.656 billion Yuan, which only amounts to 1/14 of that of the US; military expense per capita is only equal to 1/60 of that of the US; and military expense per serviceman is about only 1/30 of that of the US Armed Forces. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "The US land area is about as big as China's, but the gap in military expenditures between (the two countries) is so huge that there is no need to point out whose military strength indeed exceeds the needs of a justifiable defense," </seg>
<seg id="17"> said Peng Guangqian. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Teng Jianqun, Director of the Study Office at China's Armament Control and Disarmament Association, said that the US side should objectively comment on China's military construction, and China's peaceful development does not mean that China and the United States will become military rivals in the future. </seg>
<seg id="19"> China's Defense White Paper 2004 says that China firmly follows the path of peaceful development and implements a defensive policy of national defense. </seg>
<seg id="20"> China never threatened or threatens or will threaten any countries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> China has never established any military bases in any other countries so far, nor sent any troops to other countries; but the United States has established more than a hundred overseas military bases, and deployed more than 100,000 troops in the Asian region alone. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Zhu Feng, a professor at the International Relations College of Beijing University, said that both China and the United States should strengthen communications and exchanges through established channels between the two countries to promote understanding and mutual trust, thoroughly advance the constructive collaboration relation between China and the United States in the new century, and jointly develop and maintain peace and development in the world. </seg>

<seg id="12"> However, these things do not hinder Hamas from adjusting its strategy flexibly. Selection of an independent candidate is one compromise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> As it has been reported, to win maximum acknowledgement internationally, the Hamas leaders from home and abroad who gathered in Egypt a few days ago, had decided to select Jamal al-Khudairi, an independent person who is the Chair of the Board of Gaza Islamic University, to be the new Prime Minister. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This move has not been responded to by related parties. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Hussein, a Palestinian analyst, said that no matter who is selected as the prime minister, the most important thing is to soften the "strong" attitude of Hamas as much as possible on the selection of the candidate for prime minister, and only in this way can it assure the success of the cabinet organization. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> (Subtitle) How to Allocate Power </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The biggest challenge for Hamas in organizing its cabinet is that it lacks sufficient administrative experience from the perspective of its internal capabilities. </seg>
<seg id="18"> An article published by the Palestinian Daily Journal analyzed that although Hamas has won support from people through social welfare items, it lacks administrative experience, and a better strategy is to collaborate with the Palestinian National Liberation Movement (Fatah), which has administrative experience. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Hamas suggested to establish a "political partnership" with Fatah to organize a national coalition government after the election, but Fatah has not actively responded to it so far. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Inside Fatah, there are now different opinions on whether it should join the cabinet; some think it should join the new government to play a role in it; some refuse the invitation from Hamas and would rather become an "active opposition" in the Legislative Committee. </seg>
<seg id="21"> A well-informed source pointed out that Fatah is gradually leaning toward joining the new government after Abbas's persuasion. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Even so, Fatah will bargain with Hamas on the allocation of cabinet positions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Moreover, another path is to establish a cabinet that is out of the framework of the Legislative Committee and free of partisan leanings. </seg>
<seg id="24"> As it has been reported, Hamas has also designed a pure technocratic government, but the concrete name list of the government is unknown. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Because of the attitude of the United States and Israel, a technocratic government is a cabinet organization method that can reduce external pressure. </seg>
<seg id="26"> According to regulations of the Palestinian "Essential Law," nomination of the prime minister and the cabinet organization work will be completed within 3 to 5 weeks after a new Legislative Committee assumes office on the 16th of this month. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> (Subtitle) Where does the Armed Wing go? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Another difficult issue for organization of a new government is the weapons in the hands of Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The attitude of the United States and Israel is very strong, and they firmly request that Hamas give up violence, and refuse its joining the government with its weapons. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Hamas leader Mushir stressed on the 9th that the armed resistance is the "strategic choice" of the organization. </seg>
<seg id="31"> The armed wing issue includes two aspects of weapons' legitimacy and ownership and control of armed wings. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Hamas is acknowledged internationally because it becomes the first big party elected in the Legislative Committee through a democratic and free method, and the legitimatized path for its armed wing, the Qassam Brigades, is to integrate it into a security organization for the government. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Hamas used to suggest integrating military wings of all factions into a "People's Army" under the Palestinian National Authority, but it has not received broad responses, and has even been criticized by the Palestinian Islamic Organization (Jihad). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Palestine currently has more than 60,000 personnel in security organizations, and most of them come from the Fatah camp. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Moreover, Fatah has some armed wings and keeps loose organizational relations with them, such as the "Al-Aqsa Martyr Brigades" and "Fatah Hawks," etc. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Hamas, responsible for the cabinet organization, must make an agreement with Abbas on how to control those self-governed armed wings and reasonably allocate security and administrative power. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> As local media reported, Abbas tends to control security and intelligence troops; organizations such as the police and civilian defense can be administrated by the Internal Affairs Ministry of a new government. </seg>
<seg id="38"> However, all parties concerned are still consulting each other on this sensitive issue, and have not produced any results. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 10 (reporter: Li Jianmin). The China's Polar-Region Exploration Report 2005 issued by the State Ocean Bureau of China is the first published one since China started its polar region scientific exploration activities more than 20 years ago. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The report thoroughly reflects the major developments and accomplishments of China's scientific exploration activities, exploration logistic support, and scientific studies in the polar regions in 2005. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Based on the record of the report, China's Antarctic Inland Ice Cover Exploration Team successfully climbed to the A area of the peak of the ice mountain where the top of the inland ice cover at the South Pole was above sea level at 22:15 on January 9, 2005 (Beijing Time), and determined that the highest spot of Ice Mountain A was 4,093 meters at 3:15 on January 18 (Beijing Time). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> "On the stage of international polar-region exploration, where competition is becoming increasingly fierce, the Chinese resort to their strong will and fearless spirit, bravely exploring the new field and successfully first climbing the 'highest point of ice cover at the South Pole' with one move, and making one more dream of mankind come true at the South Pole." </seg>
<seg id="6"> Sun Zhihui, the head of the State Ocean Bureau, said: </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The report demonstrates that the 21st Antarctic Exploration Team of China accomplished its tasks completely and returned to Shanghai on March 24, 2005. The exploration lasted 151 days, and its total voyage was 26,500 nautical miles. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On November 18 of the same year, China's 22nd South Pole Exploration Team left Shanghai for Zhongshan Station at the South Pole to conduct scientific exploration activities, and would leave Zhongshan Station and return to Shanghai through Australia before the end of February 2006. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Since it is the first time for China to issue the polar-region exploration report, China's Polar-Region Exploration Report 2005 also traces back and summarizes China's polar-region exploration efforts, which started in the 80s of the 20th century. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> According to the report, China formally joined the Antarctic Treaty in 1983, and became a member country of the Antarctic Treaty, and a consulting member country of the Antarctic Treaty, and a member country of those most influential international organizations of South Pole affairs, respectively, including the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research, and the Antarctic Bureau President Council. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In 1997, China became a member of the Arctic Science Committee, and won its speaking right and decision-making right in international polar-region affairs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The report points out that in more than 20 years, China's polar-region explorations have been developed from nothing to having something, and advanced continuously into an initial size. A scientific and exploration system for the South and North Poles, including "three stations and one ship," has been formed, i.e. the Antarctic Great Wall Station established in February 1985; Zhongshan Antarctic Station established in February 1989; the Arctic Huanghe Station established in July 2004, and the "Snow Dragon" polar-region exploration ship that has assumed exploration tasks in the Antarctic and Arctic since 1994. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Based on the statistics in the report, China has organized 22 scientific explorations, 2 scientific explorations in the Arctic by using the "Snow Dragon" ship as a carrier platform in the Arctic, and 2 batches of explorations around the Arctic Huanghe Station by the end of 2005. There have been more than 3,000 person times of team members nationwide so far who have been in the Antarctic or Arctic to do field explorations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> "Currently, we are doing investigation work for the feasibility of building the third exploration station in the Antarctic, that is also China's first inland exploration station in the Antarctic," </seg>
<seg id="15"> said Sun Zhihui. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "Through more than 20 years' efforts, China's polar-region exploration cause has played a role in the world's polar-region explorations. But compared with those major countries of polar-region explorations, there is still a bigger gap (between China and them), and we must catch up with them," </seg>
<seg id="17"> he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Sun Zhihui disclosed that China will publish a polar-region exploration report every year in the future. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, February 13 (reporter: Qian Zheng). Researchers at Japan's Tokai University have developed a type of manmade biological kidney that can not only function the same as a human kidney for catabolism, but can also keep useful substances in the body. Since it is small in size and easy to transplant, it is hopeful that it will bring good news to patients who have kidney disease with the further development of the study. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> As Japan Economic and Industrial News reported a few days ago, the newly developed manmade biological kidney is composed of two parts. One is the "manmade nephron," which filters metabolites and water in the blood; the other is the "manmade urinary tubules," which extract useful substances such as water and amino acids from the original urine and sends them back into the blood. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Both the "manmade nephron" and "manmade urinary tubules" are made of hollow threads, and the internal walls of the "manmade urinary tubules" are paved with epithelial cells of urinary tubules that have the function of catabolism. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This type of epithelial cells can treat diseases caused by repeated hemodialysis and decompose the causative substance of "dialysis-related denatured starch" into an amino acid, and send it back into the blood. They can also send those substances necessary for the human body such as glucose, vitamins, and minerals back into the blood again. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Previous manmade kidneys depended on the osmosis pressure gap of dialysis to filter metabolites, which cannot totally get rid of them, and does not have the function of making amino acids and other substances return into the blood. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Researchers used goats to do the manmade kidney transplant experiment, and the inner walls of hollow threads of the manmade kidney are lined with epithelial cells from a hog. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Two weeks later, researchers confirmed that the manmade kidney is able to function. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 13 (reporter: An Pei). A leader of the State Power Supervision and Control Committee said on the 13th that although the secure power production generally maintained a stable status in 2005, secure power production still faces serious challenges. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Vice Chairman of the State Power Supervision and Control Committee Shi Yubo said at the Fifth (expanded) Session of the National Secure Power Production Committee that in 2005 China's secure power production was stable in general, and accomplished the task smoothly for power peak usage in the summertime, realized a secure power supply, actively coped with the strikes of natural disasters, and basically assured the secure and stable operation of power systems, greatly reduced equipment accidents in secure power production and general power network accidents, compared with those of last year, and the health level of power equipment was increased. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> But he pointed out that with changes in power supply and demand situations, and that many of the newly established generating sets are put into operation one after another, secure power production will face new challenges. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> These challenges include: regional, seasonal, and time interval power shortages still exist; power supply and demand situations in some regions are still tense; since a good mechanism for the price of power and coal has not been formed, supply of power and coal is still quite problematic; at the same time, the falling power and coal quality problem has not been effectively controlled, and will seriously affect stable operations of generating sets; some power network structures are fragile and their equipment is obsolete, which brings risks to systems' safety; frequent occurrences of accidents in power infrastructure construction have not completely changed, and the situation is still serious. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Shi Yubo said that with the further development of power system reform, many deep-rooted contradictions will be continuously exposed, and how to maintain stability of employee teams and assure a normal production order will be a new issue to face. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> For the secure power production work in 2006, Shi Yubo said that the basic control secure power production work should be further consolidated; an emergency control mechanism for power safety should be established and quickly perfected to strengthen responsive capabilities for emergencies; coordination between power factories and networks should be strengthened; security of big dams should be assured; safety control of power facility constructions should be strengthened to reduce occurrences of personnel injury and death accidents; information delivery work should be continuously strengthened to assure the accurate, timely, and smooth flow of power safety information. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> It has been learned that based on a new power safety control situation, this year the Power Supervision and Control Committee will revise and perfect the issued Temporary Regulations on Accident Investigation of Power Production, and at the same time will continuously issue and execute additional documents about the safety of the hydraulic power station dam and safety protection of the secondary power system this year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> In 2005, the whole of Chinese society used a total power of 2468.9 billion KWh, and increased 13.45% compared with that of last year. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Facing the situation in which power supply and demand is still tense, and the unfavorable status of transportation problems with coal, power, and oil, power enterprises have taken effective measures and strengthened equipment control, and prevented the occurrence of large equipment accidents in national power production in all of last year. </seg>
<seg id="11"> There were 74 power network accidents, which were reduced by 127 compared with those of last year; equipment accidents were 427, which were reduced by 132 compared with those of last year. </seg>

<seg id="3"> He said at the same time that the South African government will make every effort to "strike against all forms of criminal activities." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Vusi Bruce Koloane stated that the South African government hopes to "reduce the crime rate to zero," and wants the life and asset securities of every foreigner who works in South Africa to be fully protected by local laws and citizens. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Since 2006, 4 Chinese citizens have been killed, one after another, in South Africa, and the Chinese world has broadly paid attention to it. </seg>
<seg id="6"> China's Foreign Ministry has contacted the South African side about the matter, and warned Chinese citizens who are traveling in South Africa to increase their awareness of their security and protection, and to strengthen unity and caring for each other among overseas Chinese, and to collaborate with the police to jointly strike against criminal activities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "We express our sincerest sympathy and condolences to family members of those victims." </seg>
<seg id="8"> Vusi Bruce Koloane said, "We are sorry for this, and we also want the Chinese people to believe that the South African government is carefully investigating every case related to the Chinese." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> As the embassy of South Africa presented, the South African police have successfully broken a case in which Chen Jianqing, a woman came from Fujian, China, was killed on February 5 in South Africa, and have arrested a suspect. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The police are searching for another suspect at present. </seg>
<seg id="11"> As the South African embassy in China disclosed, the suspect, who is charged with the gun death of a Hong Kong businessman in January of this year, has been arrested by the South African police, and the belongings of the victim have been recovered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> When talking about the possible impacts of the killings of Chinese citizens, Vusi Bruce Koloane thinks that those incidents will "indeed" impact trade, tourism, and exchanges in other fields between the two countries, and produce negative outcomes. But in the long run, those impacts "should not be big." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> As Tourist Attache of the South African embassy Nian Beixi presented, the embassy issued more than 2,000 visas for Chinese to go to South Africa in the first 15 days of this year. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Based on the statistical data of the Chinese government, South Africa had maintained its number one status as China's biggest trade partner in Africa in 2005. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The bilateral trade amount reached 7.27 billion USD, and increased 23% compared with that of last year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> However, people in the tourist industry think that the continuous occurrences of killing Chinese citizens in 2004 have apparently affected the number of tourists who visited South Africa. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Based on the statistics of the Sightseeing Bureau of South Africa, there were 20,331 Chinese tourists who visited South Africa in the first half of 2005, which were reduced 14.9% compared with that of last year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> There are about 200,000 Chinese who live in South Africa at present, and are scattered everywhere in the towns and villages of South Africa. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Analysts here think that since there are big gaps between the rich and poor in South African society, and a high unemployment rate, guns are spread everywhere, and no death penalty, the crime rate is still high there. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Because many Chinese do not speak English, and they carry cash with them and put cash in their homes, they become easy targets for criminals to attack them for their assets. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Working Priority of Public Security Ministry Still Focused on Supervision and Investigation on Forcing Confessions by Torture </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 14 (reporter: Meng Na). Deputy Director of the Police Affairs Supervision and Investigation Bureau of the Public Security Ministry Zheng Baigang pointed out when answering foreign reporters' questions in a news conference held by the Public Security Bureau on the 14th, that the so-called "using of methods that are not totally proper to make a crime suspect make a confession" are never allowed in China. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The working priority of the supervision and investigation departments is also to prevent these problems from happening. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="4"> He also pointed out that some international organizations do not have a thorough and correct understanding of the law enforcement status of China's police. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The newest material provided by the Public Security Ministry on the 14th demonstrates that the Case Records Regulation on Implementation of Detention by Public Security Organizations and Regulation on Continuous Interrogation Used by Public Security Organizations issued by the Public Security Ministry in 2002 and 2004, respectively, have better assured local public security units of using detention and interrogation measures according to the law. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Since 1997, to further promote the "three corrections" (i.e. corrections of forcing confessions by torture, abuse of guns and equipment by the police, and abuse of coercive measures), the public security's police affairs supervision and investigation forces have gone into grass-roots and front law enforcement units including street police stations, police teams, police patrol teams, police traffic teams, and supervision and control sites of public security units, to enforce laws on site. They have investigated law enforcement links publicly that involve citizens' personal security and rights, and made private visits for them in order to look for oversights and errors by law enforcement units, and to remind and warn them to avoid mistakes from the beginning. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> To prevent the occurrence of law enforcement problems from the beginning, police affairs supervision and investigation units have further stretched their law enforcement supervision and investigation antennas, and strengthened the supervision and investigation on law enforcement links including use of subpoena measures, inquiry and interrogation, 110 contact with the police, registered case statistics, handling of properties related to cases, records of information and materials about individuals who were fined, and stolen and hijacked mobile vehicles, etc. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Peking University Sets Up Mourning Hall to Express Condolences over Academician Wang Xuan </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 15 (reporter: Li Jiangtao). Through several days of tense arrangements, the mourning hall for Academician Wang Xuan that was set up at the Memorial of the Hundred-Year Anniversary of Peking University was formally opened at 9 a.m. on the morning of the 15th. By noon of that day, several hundred people had come and offered their condolences. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Before the mourning hall's opening time, about 8 a.m. that morning, several dozen people had waited in a long line outside the hall's gate. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Inside the memorial hall, the reporter saw the dark, horizontal banner with the calligraphy "Express Profound Condolences over Academician Wang Xuan" hanging on the wall of the Memorial of the Hundred-Year Anniversary of Peking University. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Below the banner, there was a big picture of Wang Xuan that was more than ten square meters in size. Wang was wearing a pair of glasses, smiling with a scholarly air. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Several cypress trees and several dozen wreaths were put along both sides of the picture. </seg>
<seg id="7"> An elegiac couplet on a wreath was written like this: "It began in the Qin Dynasty, prospered in the Tang Dynasty, glorified China, and skillfully laid a foundation; the contemporary Bi Sheng said farewell to the lead age, greeted the electronic one, and drew a blueprint." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Low-volume funeral music was mingled in the mourning hall, in a solemn and respectful atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Among groups who came to express their condolences, there were leaders, teachers, students of Peking University, and friends, colleagues, students, neighbors of Academician Wang Xuan, and also, many strangers who did not know him. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Some of them held fresh flowers in their hands; some carried flower baskets; everybody, wearing small white flowers on their chests, slowly walked to the picture of Academician Wang Xuan, and bowed to express their condolences. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Many could not help but weep warm tears. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Zhang Wenbin, who was the Director of the State's Cultural Relic Bureau and an old alumnus of Peking University, told the reporter that, more than ten years ago, when he worked in Henan Province, he invited Professor Wang Xuan to give a report on scientific and technological innovation for cadres of the provincial Party Committee. </seg>
<seg id="13"> "The conduct and academic studies of Academician Wang Xuan are the model for us to learn. He made important contributions for the country and society, and people will never forget him." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Jin Ruilin, a professor at Peking University's Law School, has been an old friend and neighbor of Wang Xuan for more than 40 years. </seg>
<seg id="15"> He just left the hospital several days ago, and insisted on coming today to say farewell to his old friend. </seg>
<seg id="16"> When Mr. Jin wrote his words in the visitors' book, he could not help but sadden and wipe the tears pouring from his eyes many times with tissues. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> He told the reporter that Professor Wang Xuan lived a very simple life, "when he lived in Tongfu Yuan, he had already been a professor and had accomplished significant achievements. But he still lived in a very small one-level house for many years. </seg>
<seg id="18"> He later moved to Chengze Yuan, where he had a space of 70 to 80 square meters, and lived there for more than ten years. </seg>
<seg id="19"> He refused an offer when Peking University provided him a big 140-square-meter flat in the Academician Building located in Lan Qiying; he also refused an upper-floor flat provided by Fangzheng Building. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Mr. Jin recalled and said with deep emotion that when Wang Xuan visited foreign countries, he simply refused to take positions with very good offers provided by foreign institutions. </seg>
<seg id="21"> "He insisted on not applying for the title of Academician at the beginning; then he gave up and filled out an application only after Mr. Zhou Peiyuan went to get him moving him many times." </seg>
<seg id="22"> Another thing that moved Mr. Jin was Wang Xuan's attitude toward the training of young people, "he himself stressed many times that what should be found and relied on are not what achievements I have achieved, not myself, but the training of young people." </seg>
<seg id="23"> Mr. Jin said that when Wang Xuan was around more than 50 years old, he started to pay attention to cultivating young people. He had stressed that we should pave a path, be willing to become a human ladder, and make way for young people. </seg>
<seg id="24"> "It is not easy at all for a very accomplished scientist to do this." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The reporter learned from the Peking University news center that the mourning hall for Academician Wang Xuan will open to the public for people coming from various circles to express their condolences from 9 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. every day from 9 a.m. on February 15 to 12:00 noon on February 19. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Professor Wang Xuan of Peking University died from a disease after the failure of a medical treatment at 11:03 p.m. on February 13 at Beijing Xiehe Hospital. He was 70 years old. He was praised as a "Contemporary Bi Sheng," and had assumed positions including Vice-Chair of the National Political Consultation Conference, Academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Academician of the Chinese Engineering Academy, and Academician of the Third World's Academy of Sciences. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 15 (reporters: Zhou Wei and Li Fei). Many networks and websites currently rely on republishing a lot of news and reports from newspapers and magazines to increase their click rates, but many of them are neither authorized, nor pay related fees. To cope with this, Director of the Copyright Department of the State Copyright Bureau Wang Ziqiang said in a press conference, held by the News Office of the State Council on the 15th, that the State Council will explain about the implementation of the Protection Regulation on Dissemination Rights for Information Networks, on the issue of paying for republishing works on the Internet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Wang Ziqiang said that according to existing laws and regulations, regarding those works published in newspapers, as long as their authors did not state that "they cannot be used," newspapers can use those works without their authors' permission, but at the same time should pay them, and the State Copyright Bureau has made the payment standard specifically for newspaper reprint practices according to the law. </seg>
<seg id="4"> However, according to regulations in existing laws, newspapers have the right to such legal permissions, but the Internet currently does not have rights for such legal permissions. </seg>
<seg id="5"> According to related interpretations made by the People's Supreme Court, the legal permission for newspaper reprints is applied to the Internet, i.e. to any small or short articles published in newspapers or on the Internet, whose authors did not state that "they cannot be used," the Internet can use them without permission, but at the same time needs to pay their authors. </seg>
<seg id="6"> But because the legal interpretation does not determine the payment standard, the Internet has not made payments when it used those works in practice. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "Regarding whether the Internet use of published small or short works applies to the legal permission, it still needs to be determined according to the laws." </seg>
<seg id="8"> Wang Ziqiang said: "Whether it will be included in a category of law depends on the confirmation of the implementation of the Protection Regulation on Dissemination Rights for Information Networks this year." </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 15 (reporter: Song Shiyi). Xie Duofu, a news officer for the Russian Defense Ministry, told the media on the 15th that the resolution made by the Georgian Parliament on Russia's peacekeeping troops will not affect the Russian military's peacekeeping activities in the short term, and Russian troops will continue to fulfill their peacekeeping mission in the conflict area of South Ossetia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The Chair of the Russian Independent State Affairs Committee of the State Duma (lower house of the parliament), Kokoshin, made a speech and indicated regarding the resolution made by the Georgian Parliament on Russia's peacekeeping troops, on the same day the resolution was published, that the resolution will harm the stability of the situation in that area and negatively impact the relations between Russia and Georgia. </seg>
<seg id="4"> He stressed that the resolution made by the Georgian Parliament is a further bad step toward damaging the relations between Russia and Georgia. </seg>
<seg id="5"> He thinks that the Georgian accusation against the Russian side is absurd. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The Georgian Parliament passed the resolution on that day, and requested Russia's peacekeeping troops to stop their peacekeeping activities in South Ossetia, but did not set a concrete deadline for Russia's peacekeeping troops to withdraw. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The Georgian Parliament accuses Russia's peacekeeping personnel of a failure to fulfill their designated obligation, and regards the actions taken by Russia in the conflict area as "trying to annex Georgian territory." </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, February 16 (reporter: Zhou Liquan). After the large fire disaster occurred at the Central Hospital of Liaoyuan City in Jilin Province, an accident investigation group determined that 11 individuals are responsible, and among them, the head of the electrician team of the hospital, Zhang Diankun, and three other persons will be prosecuted as liable for the big accident. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The Central Hospital, the largest one in Liaoyuan City, experienced a big fire on December 15, 2005, which eventually took 39 lives. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The total burned area in this fire disaster was more than 5,000 square meters. </seg>
<seg id="5"> As it has been learned, this is the biggest fire accident in the national medical and health system since New China was established. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> As was investigated, at around 16:30 on the day the accident occurred, there was a sudden power failure at the Central Hospital of Liaoyuan City. Based on the hospital's electrical circuit design, if there is a power failure, the circuit breaker in the transformer box should automatically switch to a backup socket to maintain normal power supply for the hospital. But at that time the circuit breaker did not automatically switch to the socket. Zhang Diankun, the head of the technician team, forced the power supply without investigating and clarifying the cause of the power failure, and caused the fire disaster. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Those smoky underground cables, which should be laid out on a flat surface in very good order, were tangled together without any order, and fire prevention layers should be set up. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Thus, three individuals including Zhao Yongchun, the 57-year-old head of the electrical equipment installation team of the Textile Company of Liaoyuan City, Sun Fenglin, a retired cadre (senior engineer) from the Liaoyuan Power Affairs Bureau, and Jin Taicheng, a reemployed retiree worker at the Central Hospital of Liaoyuan City, will be prosecuted as suspects in the liability for the big accident. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Central Organization Department of CCP Requires Further Strengthening of Supervision Work for Selection and Appointment of Leaders and Cadres </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 16. The Central Organization Department recently printed and issued a suggestion regarding strengthening the supervision work for cadres. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The suggestion requires that Party organization departments at every level should strictly control, care for, and protect cadres, and conduct supervision work for cadres at every stage of cadres' cultivation and education, review and test, selection and appointment, and routine management, and establish, perfect, and strengthen prevention work, promptly discover problems in the supervision work mechanism, seriously correct them, and truly strengthen the supervision work for selection and appointment of leaders and cadres. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The suggestion points out that the primary tasks of the organization departments for cadre supervision include, first, supervision of the leadership team and leaders, and its priority is to strengthen supervision of the major leader of a leadership team; second, supervision of the selection and appointment work of leaders of the Party and administrations, and its priority is to supervise and review implementation of the Working Regulation on Selection and Appointment of leaders of the Party and Administrations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> With regards to the supervision of the leadership team and leaders, the suggestion proposes that the ideal and good-faith education and anti-corruption and honesty promotion education should be consistently adhered to, and those educations should be practiced in cultivation, selection, control, and supervision of cadres, guide and urge leaders to strengthen their training of the Party spirit, and stick to strengthening the ideological and ethical frontline, emphasizing that the Party is established for the public, the administration is for the people, and anti-corruption is to prevent degeneration. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Honesty and self-discipline should clearly come up as requirements when talking with newly promoted cadres in their appointment meetings. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Leadership teams at every level should be urged to stick to the democratic centralization system, establish and perfect rules and procedures for meetings and decision-making, and carefully practice the system that integrates collective leadership with individual responsibility in related fields. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The supervision over the major leader of a leadership team should be emphasized. Leaders of organization (personnel) departments should frequently talk with and conduct heart-to-heart talks with the major leader of a leadership team at the next lower level to learn the status of his ideology, work, and style of work, etc. </seg>
<seg id="9"> A routine control and supervision system should be established and perfected for leaders; the status of ideology and style of work of a leadership team should be regularly learned and analyzed, and suggestions and measures should be come up with to solve problems. </seg>
<seg id="10"> A warning talk and letter inquiry system for leaders should be practiced. Once the hint of a problem emerges, a warning talk or letter inquiry should be promptly conducted. </seg>
<seg id="11"> As for those obvious problems with leaders reported by the masses, they should be carefully investigated and clarified; if a problem is true, the leader concerned should be criticized and educated, or disciplined by appropriate organizational measures; if any leader violates any regulation or law, he or she should be transferred to the law or discipline enforcement organization to be investigated; if a leader is found innocent through an investigation, a clarification should be addressed for him or her in a proper manner. </seg>
<seg id="12"> At the same time, strengthening supervision of cadres should be integrated by encouraging cadres to boldly explore and develop innovations, and excellent cadres should be discovered and promptly commended. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The Suggestion requires that organization (personnel) departments at every level should truly strengthen the supervision work of selection and appointment of leaders of the Party and administrations. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Supervision measures on the stages of cadres' recommendation, nomination, test and review, discussion, and determination, etc., should be further perfected, and cadres should be strictly selected and used, and vigorous support should be provided for recommendation and selection of cadres who are politically reliable, talented at their work, maintain a good style of work, and are trusted by the masses of people to take leadership positions at every level. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The implementation status of the regulations for cadre appointment should be reviewed vigorously. Any conduct that violates the regulations for cadre appointment should be seriously investigated and disciplined, and indecent practices and corruption in the use of cadres should be firmly contained. </seg>
<seg id="16"> A supervision and investigation system for any serious violation of regulations for the use of cadres should be practiced to further strengthen supervision, investigation, and disciplinary work. </seg>
<seg id="17"> A system of selection and appointment of cadres - and investigation of their working responsibility - should be established and perfected. Based on the principle that power matches responsibility, every stage of the cadres' selection and appointment work, including the main body of responsibility and content of responsibility, should be scientifically defined, and an investigation method should be clarified to strengthen investigation work. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The supervision role played by the masses should be fully exercised to establish and perfect a reporting mechanism that is "convenient, secure, and highly efficient." </seg>
<seg id="19"> The supervision role played by public opinion should be fully employed, and the status of cadres' selection and appointment work should be notified to the news media within an appropriate amount of time, and accept the supervision of public opinion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The suggestion proposes that a coordination mechanism of cadre supervision work should be further perfected. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Organization (personnel) departments should strengthen coordination with discipline investigation organizations, establish a work communication system, contact person system, and responsibility system, with discipline investigation organizations in the aspect of cadres' fair administration and their Party spirit, in order to strengthen integrated supervision. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Visiting and investigation work should be carefully and well done with discipline investigation organizations; visiting and investigating methods can be improved and perfected to promote visiting and investigation quality. </seg>
<seg id="23"> An auditing system for leaders' economic responsibility should be carefully practiced with auditing organizations. </seg>
<seg id="24"> An internal supervision mechanism for cadres' selection and appointment work of the organization departments should be perfected. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 16 (reporter: Chen Jianxing). On the 15th, an economic affairs administration of the Taiwan authorities decided to fine Lianhua Electronics Corporation (shortened name: "Liandian"), one of "the two giant wafer producers" in Taiwan, 5 million New Taiwan Dollars, because it "violates regulation by providing assistance and participating in creation" for Hejian Science and Technology Company on the Mainland. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Taiwan's China Times reported that this is the first case used by Taiwanese authorities to fine and discipline a Taiwanese business that invested on the Mainland since Chen Shui-bian came up with the economic and trade policy of "actively controlling and effectively opening." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> As has been reported, a person from the Taiwan "Report and Review Committee of the Economic Department" said that the reason why Liandian was fined was because it violated "the Regulation of the People's Relation across the Strait," and regulations of "Permission Methods for Investment and Technological Cooperation on the Mainland." </seg>
<seg id="5"> In the future, the Report and Review Committee will fine Tsao Hsing-cheng, former Chair of the Board of Liandian, according to the circumstances. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The "Liandian Case" originated in February 2005, and by then Taiwanese investigation departments had used around a hundred people to hurriedly search the residences and offices of several high-level Liandian employees, and alleged that Liandian was suspected of investing on the Mainland and "illegally providing capital, technology, and human resources" to Hejian Science and Technology Company. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Tsao Hsing-cheng, the then-Chair of the Liandian Board, later publicly stated that Liandian did not violate any of the Taiwan authorities' regulations, and the assistance Liandian provided to Hejian Science and Technology was for Liandian's long-term interest, and Liandian would lose business opportunities if it did not enter the Mainland market as soon as possible. </seg>
<seg id="8"> After that, the "Financial Supervision and Control Committee" of the Taiwan authorities fined Liandian 3 million New Taiwan Dollars for its violation of the regulation regarding disclosure of commercial information. </seg>
<seg id="9"> On January 9, 2006, the Liandian Board accepted Tsao Hsing-cheng's resignation, and he was formally prosecuted for violation of regulations on investment on the Mainland within several hours. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Liandian and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (shortened name: TSMC) are called "the two giant wafer producers" in Taiwan, and both are leading high-tech enterprises on the island. </seg>
<seg id="11"> A series of investigations and disciplinary actions taken by the Taiwan authorities against Liandian have attracted close attention from various circles on the island. </seg>

<seg id="1"> State Safety Supervision Bureau: Containment of Frequently-Occurring Large and Major Accidents in Coal Mines is Top of This Year's Priorities </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 17 (reporter: Liu Zheng). Since four large mine accidents - in each of which around a hundred miners lost their lives - have continuously occurred, the serious situation of national safe production in the past year has caused "containment of frequently-occurring large and major accidents in coal mines" to become the highest among national safety supervision work priorities for this year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The reporter learned from the State's Supervision and Control Bureau of Safe Production on the 17th that for the purpose of truly containing large and major accidents frequently occurring in coal or other mines, coal mines are the highest among priorities. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The State's Supervision and Control Bureau of Safe Production will focus on the following three things for coal mine safety this year: </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> --Continue to effectively fight for gas control. </seg>
<seg id="6"> "Extraction first and collection later" should be the priority for gas control this year. </seg>
<seg id="7"> If a shaft that has dense gas does not practice the method of "extraction first and collection later," it should be ordered by law to stop production immediately. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> --Continue to effectively fight for consolidation and closure. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Those 5,243 shafts announced to the public, and more than 700 coal mine shafts recently reported from many local areas, should be completely and truly shut down. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Closure should be regarded as a regular activity, and those coal mines that damage resources, pollute the environment, and lack safe conditions, should be continuously shut down. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> --Strengthen basic control of coal mine safety. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Immediately correct and stop losing management in a few big state-owned mines, and guide small mines that have mismanagement in establishing standard safety and management systems. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Especially, major state-owned coal mines should be paid more attention to, and any productions exceeding their capacities, intensities, and fixed number of employees should never be allowed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The controlled percentages for safe production for this year require the number of deaths in various accidents nationwide to be decreased 3% compared with that of last year, and among them, the number in coal mines to be decreased 3.5%. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The number of large accidents that cause more than ten deaths each should be decreased by 5%, and among them, the number in coal mines should be decreased 7%. </seg>
<seg id="16"> These controlled percentages have been announced to every provincial people's government, and local administrations are dividing them in terms of different levels and allocating them to grass-roots and businesses. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Statistics show that there were 5,986 victims in coal mine accidents nationwide in 2005, and the number was 0.7% lower compared with that of last year. </seg>
<seg id="18"> However, large accidents that had more than ten victims each have increased, and the number of victims has increased 66.6% compared with that of last year. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Turin, February 17. News Analysis: Pyleva Incident Might Be Settled by Leaving it Unsettled </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Xinhua News Agency Reporters: Gao Peng, Ding Ying </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Although Italy reiterated that any athletes who are discovered using stimulants may face the "disaster of being jailed," many cases currently demonstrate that it is unlikely to happen to Russian women's biathlon athlete Olga Pyleva, who is at the center of the first scandal over stimulant use at the Winter Olympic Games. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The first stimulant use scandal at the Turin Winter Olympic Games was exposed on the 16th, and Olga Pyleva was discovered to have used the illegal and banned drug carphedon. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The next day, the International Olympic Committee announced that Pyleva had been thrown out of the Winter Olympic Games, and the silver medal she won for the 15 km women's biathlon had been withdrawn. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The same day, the International Winter Biathlon Alliance determined to forbid Pyleva to participate in the sport for two years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The International Olympic Committee has been implementing the regulation that once athletes are discovered using stimulants, they will lose their qualification to participate in the Games, and the scores they achieved will be withdrawn, but they are not subject to legal punishment. </seg>
<seg id="9"> However, according to Italian law, the carrying and use of stimulants by any athlete are criminal activities. A law enforcement organization has the right to directly arrest and investigate any athlete who uses stimulants. Any violators of the law are subject to jail for 3 months to 3 years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The International Olympic Committee had been "bargaining" with the Italian government for one year, and eventually reached an agreement last December. Both sides agreed that during the period of the Winter Olympic Games, any athletes who use stimulants would be handled according to Italian laws. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Through the unremitting efforts made by the International Olympic Committee, the Italian side made a compromise four days before the opening ceremonies of the Winter Olympic Games, and promised that the police would not enter the Olympic Village to search athlete residences during the Olympic Games. But any athletes whose drug tests show positive will be investigated by Italian prosecution organizations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Some reports said that Pescante, an official of the Italian government responsible for supervision of the Turin Winter Olympic Games, has transferred Pyleva's stimulant case to a Turin prosecution organization. </seg>
<seg id="13"> However, the International Olympic Committee and Pescante himself have not confirmed this so far. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Andrey Dmytriev, a doctor for the Russian Biathlon Team ,disclosed at noontime on the 17th that Pyleva had left Turin and returned home. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Shi Kangcheng, a Chinese sports official who had been in a position at the World Anti-Stimulant Organization for many years, thinks that once Pyleva returns home, this case might eventually "be settled by leaving it unsettled." </seg>
<seg id="16"> Shi Kangcheng said that the International Olympic Committee and the Italian government have not "completely addressed" the anti-stimulant issue at the Winter Olympic Games, and it is hard to say what the outcome would be even if Italian prosecution organizations really did get involved in the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Based on past penalty cases in which Italy sentenced or punished its own athletes who used stimulants, the most serious penalty was merely a "two-year probation." </seg>
<seg id="18"> Thus, senior reporter Piali from the Italian ANSA said that the possibility of Pyleva being jailed is "very small," and at most, she might be fined. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Piali also said that although an Italian court could sentence her by default, it is impossible for the Italian police to catch Pyleva abroad and bring her back to serve the sentence. </seg>
<seg id="20"> If Pyleva refuses to accept the sentence, the Italian side can do nothing about it. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Experts pointed out that Egypt is an important passage for migrant birds in the Middle East and North Africa. The possibility of migrant birds bringing bird flu virus across borders is very high. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Egypt has announced a ban on import of any live poultries from foreign countries, and strengthened quarantine work at border ports. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> More than 800 chickens died of unknown causes on a chicken farm in the capital of Cameroon, Yaounde, in the past week. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Cameroon has decided to immediately suspend imports of all poultries and pork from Nigeria, where the bird flu epidemic was discovered, and discontinued trade of poultries and related products in markets in border areas between the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The Cameroonian government has also established a monitoring and detection network that can cover its overall territories for epidemic detection. Its Bayside Center and the State Veterinary Laboratory are also under an emergency status so that they can deploy any test work associated with the H5N1 virus at any time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> In Europe, Denmark and Sweden initially excluded the epidemic on the 17th. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The Swedish Veterinary Institute issued a test result that shows the dead swans found in Sweden this Wednesday were not infected with the bird flu virus. </seg>
<seg id="13"> An initial test result done by the Danish State Veterinary Control Bureau also showed that the 30 dead swans found in Danish territories in recent days were not infected with the bird flu virus. </seg>
<seg id="14"> But an agricultural department stated that Denmark still cannot lower its guard. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> 9 bird flu epidemic spots have been discovered in Romania in Eastern Europe this year. WHO experts in Bucharest said on the 17th that bird flu has spread to almost every area of the Delta Region of the Danube River, and the situation must be carefully coped with, and Romania might be continuously threatened by bird flu within 3 to 5 years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> In Bangladesh in Asia, the government has taken every measure necessary to prevent bird flu. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The government's Poultry Service Bureau has provided related officials books about prevention of bird flu, and also simultaneously organized poultry raisers for trainings. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 18. As the Blood Center of Zhejiang Province disclosed, China's first blood sharing information data management and control network system has recently been formally established at the center and has been put into operation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> A leader involved with the Blood Center of Zhejiang Province said that this means that any citizen who has freely donated his blood in any county (city, district) blood collection and supply institutions of Zhejiang Province will have a unique code record. When he donates blood again, information that determines if he is qualified to donate his blood will immediately show up as long as his code record, individual information, blood type, blood donation record, and time of last blood donation are entered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The leader further explained that if the system shows a free-blood donor is still within an interval period through entering the related code records, it will point out that the person does not meet the requirements for blood donation at this time. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In this way it can protect not only the health of the blood donor, but also the health and safety of blood recipients. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Manila, February 18. Local Philippines officials said on the 18th that 11 villages in the eastern Philippines have been hurriedly evacuated in case a similar mudslide occurs again. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Rosette Lerias, a Southern Leyte Province official, said on that day that those villages are located in the same area as the village where a mudslide occurred on the 17th, and the terrain features are similar. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Residents of the 11 villages who were evacuated will be placed in 7 evacuation centers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Lerias said that the government ordered residents to evacuate yesterday, and today it sent people to check those villages because some of the villagers do not want to leave their homes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The mudslide incident occurred on the 17th close to a village located beside a mountain in St. Bernard Township in the southern part of South Leyte Province. Mud and rocks had buried the entire village, and only a few roofs could be seen from TV footage. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Since mud is very thick and wet, there is almost no hope for buried humans to survive. </seg>
<seg id="8"> At present, 109 people have been found dead and 57 people have been rescued. </seg>
<seg id="9"> As has been estimated, the number of deaths caused by the incident may be as high as 1,800. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> London, the 6th (AFP) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> London's Daily Express has reported that two laptop computers containing material on the probe into Princess Diana's fatal car crash in Paris in 1997 have been stolen from the office of a former metropolitan police commissioner. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The report says the theft has given rise to conjecture that the computers may contain confidential material from the investigation headed by former Metropolitan Police Commissioner Lord Stevens. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> However, a spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Police said the computers did not contain any sensitive information or any material linked to the probe. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Lord Stevens is the chief constable of Northumbria Police in England. His office is located in Newcastle upon Tyne. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The report said detectives with the Northumbria Police have been investigating two burglaries in the last ten days. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The first took place on the weekend of January 28 to 29 when the computers and cash were taken. The second burglary took place last week, but without any loss. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Northumbria Police also said there was no evidence that the two break-ins were linked to Lord Stevens' work. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Stevens has been investigating if the princess of Wales' death was not the result of a straightforward car accident. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In 2004, Royal Coroner Burgess ordered further investigation into related evidence. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Princess Diana died in a car crash in a Paris tunnel on August 31, 1997. Her lover, Fayed, and a chauffeur were also killed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> A two-year investigation by French police concluded that the tragedy resulted because the chauffeur, who was drunk and taking prescription drugs, was driving too fast and lost control. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The unrelenting advance of bird flu across Europe is causing anxiety among the public. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The European Commission (EC) approved the establishment of "buffer zones" which would cover entire areas of infected countries and in which trade and transport of poultry products would be prohibited. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In Africa, where the lethal H5N1 strain of the virus was discovered eight days ago in Nigeria, the disease has continued spread to more poultry farms and showed signs of having crossed the northern border into Niger. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Egyptian officials are also investigating the sudden unexplained death of a batch of chickens in a poultry farm, raising concerns that the virus may continue to spread. </seg>

<seg id="7"> The virus has influenced Europe's poultry markets, where sales have plummeted. The European Commission reiterated that there was no need for panic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> EU health and food commissioner, Kyprianou, said, "It is understandable that the public is concerned, but they need not be unduly alarmed." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Following provisions for three-kilometer protection zones and ten-kilometer surveillance zones around virus outbreak points, the European Commission also issued a regulation that will turn entire regions where the virus is found into "buffer zones". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> An EU official wishing to remain anonymous said that everybody was very tense and that from morning to night they were handling news coming in from areas all over Europe where it was suspected that the epidemic had erupted. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> In Europe, traces of the H5N1 virus have already appeared in Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Germany, Greece, Italy, Romania, Slovenia, Ukraine and the European part of Russia. Almost all cases have appeared in wild swans. </seg>

<seg id="12"> Romania discovered its thirty-first case on the 16th. New cases have also been discovered in Slovenia, Austria and Greece, as well as on the German island of Ruegan. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> BEIJING, February 6 (Xinhua)(Reporter: Han Jie, Xu Bo) Reporters were informed on the 6th by the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) that two rules recently issued by the CBRC--the Electronic Banking Administration Measures and the Electronic Banking Security Assessment Guide--will take effect on March 1, 2006. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> A CBRC spokesman said that according to provisions of the Administration Measures, the examination and authorization method for foreign-capital financial institutions remains essentially unchanged. Namely, if foreign bank branches that have already been authorized to open online banking services need to add additional online banking products, their primary reporting bank must submit a consolidated application. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> , In June 2001, the China People's Bank promulgated the Interim Measures for the Administration of Online Banking Operations to standardize use of the Internet by commercial banks in developing banking services. </seg>
<seg id="5"> A CBRC spokesman said that with the continuous development of the online banking operations of commercial banks, the Interim Measures no longer answered the need for supervision and control of risks in online banking. For this reason, the CBRC enacted the two new regulations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> According to the CBRC spokesman, the CBRC's approval of the qualifications of security assessment organizations is different from the administrative approval of qualifications for industry access or market access. It is not a prerequisite for assessment organizations developing electronic banking security assessment services, but is instead only a reference for financial institutions choosing an assessment organization. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Financial institutions can hire a security assessment organization to perform e-banking security assessments as long as the assessment organization complies with relevant conditions and requirements, even if its qualifications have not undergone CBRC approval. Assessments must however be supervised in accordance with relevant regulations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The Electronic Banking Administration Measures are divided into 99 items under nine chapters covering general principles, application and change of registration, risk management, management of information exchange and transfer, supervision of out-sourcing, supervision of trans-national business, oversight and administration, legal liability and supplementary provisions. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The Electronic Banking Security Assessment Guide is divided into 57 items under five chapters, covering general principles, security assessment organizations, implementation of security assessments, administration of security assessment activity and supplementary provisions. </seg>

<seg id="1"> (Newspaper excerptï¼Shanghai: Part-timers and University Grads Become Main Source of Hourly Workers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> BEIJING, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) The Shanghai Bureau of Labor and Social Security released on the 6th the "2006 Most Recent Guidance for Hourly Wages". It covers 120 kinds of positions--11 more than the last edition--and reveals that wages for certain positions previously covered have risen in some cases and fallen in others. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> According to estimates by experts at the Shanghai Bureau of Labor and Social Security, the number of hourly workers now exceeds one million. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> China Youth Daily has reported that university graduates and part-timers are the main source of hourly workers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Results of a direct survey of nearly 8000 hourly workers show that more than half are part-timers, with the percentage reaching 51.1%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The educational level of these part-timers is generally high, with most engaged in highly technical labor such as translation work, in which part-timers make up 81.7% of the manpower.  In the fitness industry, they occupy up to 61.6% of the positions. </seg>
<seg id="7"> High income is one of the main reasons many people do hourly part-time work. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> According to sources, the monthly income from some positions can be in the tens of thousands of yuan with manpower still being in short supply. Simultaneous interpretation is one such example. The monthly income for most hourly positions--such as part-time accountants and wedding masters of ceremony--can reach 2000 yuan or more. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Another important reason that hourly part-time work has become popular is the desire to satisfy personal interest and expand one's knowledge. </seg>
<seg id="10"> For example, Mr. Gu, manager of an enterprise's human resources department, spends several hours each week processing financial accounts for the representative office of a foreign company. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Mr. Gu says the greatest benefits of part-time work are the continuous upgrading of one's knowledge and the opportunity to dabble in a different field. Of course, the 2000 yuan in monthly income is also attractive. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Because some hourly positions have a low threshold and flexible work arrangements, they are gradually finding favor with many job-seeking graduates. Fourteen percent of hourly workers graduated from university or technical schools in the last three years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> "Initially, I wasn't interested in hourly work. But after a few months, I feel that it is better than a nine-to-five job." </seg>
<seg id="14"> After Young Huang graduated from university, he could not find a job he liked. Finally, he signed up at a hotel to play background music on a piano. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "At 100 yuan an hour and with the good environment, I am very satisfied with my job. What I need now is to find more hourly jobs." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> According to reports, hourly jobs have become an important route for job-hunting graduates to accumulate work experience, hone their work skills, improve their communication skills and gain increased social experience. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Graduates doing hourly work are mostly concentrated in positions requiring a high level of knowledge and skills, such as highly specialized translating positions and positions involving highly contemporary art or entertainment work. These two fields account for 22.1% and 26.8% respectively. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Some hourly positions, such as foodstuff salespersons and shipping clerks, do not require a high level of skill and can be filled by unemployed persons following some simple training. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Data shows that the unemployed make up 39% of hourly workers. The proportion of unemployed workers is as high as 68.4% in retail-related positions and 58.7% in catering-related positions. Hourly work has become an important path to employment for the unemployed. </seg>

<seg id="1"> China Puts Forth Major Research Programs for Next 15 Years </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua)(Reporter: Li Xing)In a bid to increase China's international competitiveness, vigorously promote sustainable development, and realize breakthroughs in key areas, the National Guideline on Medium- and Long-Term Programs for Science and Technology Development (2006-2020) published by the State Council on the 9th lays out four areas of major scientific research. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The four major scientific programs are the study of protein, research into the control of quanta, nano research and the study of growth and reproduction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The guideline says protein science is a peak of the life sciences that has developed countries energetically vying with each other. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In the next 15 years, China will give top priority to the study of the transcriptomics of major biological systems, proteomics, metabolomics, structural biology, protein's biological capabilities and other interactions, biology and system biology for protein-related calculations, methodology for protein research and basic research for related applications. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The guideline also said that research into the control of quanta was clearly foresighted and that in twenty to thirty years it may have imponderable impact on mankind's social and economic development. </seg>
<seg id="7"> China must give top priority to the study of quantum information carriers as well as the principles and methods of control, quantum calculation, the effect of new quanta on limited small quanta systems, new principles and new technical foundations for the characterization and measure of quantum control. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Furthermore, the guideline says nano technology has become the strategic choice of many countries for upgrading their core competitiveness and is also a realm is which China has hope of achieving great leaps in development. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In the next 15 years, China's key research in the domain will include controllable preparation, self-assembly and enabling of nano-particles; nano-electronics; nano-biology and nano-medicine; nano measuring, characterization and metrics; and the use of nano particles and nano technology in various fields, including energy, environment, information, and medicine. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The growth in China's population is large and there are many born with defects. There is a serious shortage of organs for transplant and a peak in the aging of the population is coming. For this reason, there is an urgent need for breakthroughs and technical innovation in the reproduction and developmental sciences. </seg>
<seg id="11"> According to the Guidelines, in 2006-2020 China will focus its research on stem cell proliferation, division and control; the occurrence, maturation and fertilization of reproductive cells; the decline of human reproductive capabilities and the mechanism for degenerative illnesses; and the safety and principles of assisted reproduction and stem cell technology. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Chinese Experts: US Making Groundless Accusations by Playing Up "China Military Threat" </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> BEIJING, Feb. 9 (Xinhua)  (Reporters: Li Xuanliang, Xiong Zhengyan, Lin Liping) In the Quadrennial Defense Review it formally submitted recently to Congress, the US Pentagon has said for the first time that China is "the emerging power that has the greatest potential to militarily challenge the United States." </seg>
<seg id="3"> Experts say this is unreasonable finger-pointing at China's normal defense construction, an exaggeration of the "Chinese military threat" and an interference in China's internal affairs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The Quadrennial Defense Review is the Pentagon's new national defense guidelines. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The 92-page report devotes three paragraphs to the issue of China's military and the countermeasures the United States should take. The report makes 15 direct references to "China" or "Chinese" and says that "as an important emerging power, China has the greatest potential to compete militarily with the United States. If the United States fails to take countermeasures, China will very likely field disruptive military technologies that could offset traditional U.S. military advantages". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Yao Yunzhu, researcher with the Department of World Military Research at the Chinese Academy of Military Sciences, said that although senior US officials have expressed similar viewpoints on various earlier occasions, this is the first time that the US has said in the defense report that "China is the major emerging power that has the greatest potential to compete militarily with the United States". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "It is the first time that this report has explicitly referred to Russia, India and China as rising strategic opponents and, in particular, focused more on the so-called 'Chinese military threat'," </seg>
<seg id="8"> said Major General Peng Guangqian, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Military Sciences. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Worthy of note is that on the same day the Quadrennial Defense Review was officially submitted, US President Bush also submitted the government budget for the 2007 fiscal year to Congress. It included US$439.3bn earmarked for national defense. </seg>
<seg id="10"> "If the budget supplemented for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan is included, the American national defense budget for the 2007 fiscal year will top US$500bn to reach an all-time high," Peng Guangqian said. "This is almost equal to the total of the defense expenditures of the rest of the world's countries." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Peng Guangqian says fabrication of "foreign threats" by the United States reflects the Pentagon's consistent  style of "manufacturing  enemies", and that its real intention is to secure more defense funds so as to bring in more profits for the colossal weapons industry groups of the United States. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Experts say that compared to the huge military expenditure of the United States, China's national defense spending is very limited. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Military expert Deng Hongzhou, who has participated several times in the compilation of the white book on Chinese national defense, said that since the 1990s China's national defense spending has indeed increased as its economic has developed, but its proportion of the national financial expenditure in the same period has shown an overall downward trend. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Official data shows that compared with 1979, the proportion that China's 2004 national defense expenditure took in the national financial expenditure in the same period dropped by nearly 10%. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In 2005, China's national defense expenditure was Rmb244.656bn, equal to only 1/14 that of the US; the per capita military expenditure was equal to only about 1/60 that of the US and military expenditure per serviceman was equal to 1/30 that of the US military. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "The US is about as large as China in terms of territory, but the difference in their military spending is so great. It is self-evident whose military power has exceeded the needs of legitimate defense," </seg>
<seg id="17"> Peng Guangqian said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Teng Jianqun, director of the Research Department of the China Association of Armament Control and Disarmament, says that the US should objectively evaluate China's military construction and adds that China's peaceful development does not mean that China and the US will become military adversaries in the future. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The 2004 China National Defense white book says that China keeps firmly to the road of peaceful development and implements a defensive national defense policy. </seg>
<seg id="20"> China is no threat to any country, either in the past, at present or in the future. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> To date, China has established no military base in any other country and has not sent even a single soldier to another country. In contrast, the US keeps some 100 military bases abroad and has deployed 100,000 troops in Asian alone. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Professor Zhu Feng of the College of International Relations, Beijing University says China and the US should use existing channels to increase communication and exchange, improve mutual understanding and trust, promote a constructive Sino-US partnership in the new century and jointly promote and maintain world peace and development. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> RAMALLAH, Feb. 9 (Xinhua)(International Observation) Hamas Seeks Breakthrough in Forming Cabinet </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> (Xinhua Reporters: Wang Hao, Huang Min) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Following the victory of Palestine's Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) in parliamentary elections, how the new government will be laid out has become a focus of international attention. </seg>
<seg id="5"> What kind of policies Hamas carries out will directly influence the policy directions taken by the various parties involved in the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="6"> At the same time, the resistant attitude of the US and Israel will be an additional variable in the prospects of the Hamas-lead government. </seg>
<seg id="7"> At present, the different Palestinian sides are stepping up discussions in an active quest for a breakthrough in problems and sensitive issues that the cabinet formation poses toward future development of the situation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> (subhead) Who Will Become Prime Minister? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Since Hamas won the right to form a cabinet, some outsiders have expressed worry that a split could take place between the "Hamas Prime Minister" and the Palestinian leader, Abbas. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In addition, the leader of Hamas, Mashaal, who is currently visiting Egypt, stressed that a Palestinian government formed by the leaders of Hamas would not recognize Israel, a hard-line signal that heightened international concern. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The US and Israel have clearly stated they will not accept a Hamas-led government with real power and have threatened to cut off economic aid to Palestine and freeze the transfer of tax revenues. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But this has not prevented Hamas from carrying out some agile strategic adjustments, including a compromise policy of selecting independents. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> According to reports, in order to maximize recognition from the international community, in recent days overseas and domestic leaders of Hamas gathered in Egypt decided to select an independent figure, Ismail Haniyeh, chairman of the board of Gaza Islamic University, to become the new prime minister. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Concerned parties have not yet responded to the move. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Palestinian analyst Hisham said that, whoever takes over the prime-ministership, the most important thing is that the person should be capable of toning down Hamas' hard-line character, since only in this way can the success of the cabinet be guaranteed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> (subhead) How will authority be distributed? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> From an internal perspective, the biggest challenge faced by the Hamas-led cabinet is a lack of adequate experience in power. </seg>
<seg id="18"> An analysis in an article in the Palestinian daily Al-Ayyam said that Hamas gained popularity through social welfare projects but lacked experience in office. Cooperation with the Palestinian National Liberation Movement, or Fatah, will be the best solution. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> After the election, Hamas raise the possibility of a "political partnership" with Fatah and the joint establishment of a national coalition government, but until now Fatah has not given a positive response. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Fatah is internally split regarding whether to participate in the cabinet. One faction advocates taking part in the new government in order to have some sway; another faction refuses the invitation by Hamas and wants instead to be "an active opposition" in parliament. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Informed sources say Fatah, with persuasion coming from Abbas, is gradually leaning toward participating in the new government. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Even so, Hamas and Fatah will still haggle over the distribution of cabinet posts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Another path would be to establish a cabinet outside the parliamentary framework and ignore party affiliation. </seg>
<seg id="24"> According to reports, Hamas has also laid out a government composed uniquely of experts, but the actual name list is still unknown. </seg>
<seg id="25"> In view of US and Israeli attitudes, a government of technical experts is a way of forming a cabinet that will help lighten pressure from outside. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Palestine's Basic Law provides that the naming of the prime minister and the cabinet will take three to five weeks to complete once the new parliament takes over on the 16th of this month. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> (subhead) How do the weapons fit in? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Hamas' weapons constitute another thorny issue in the forming of the new government. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The US and Israel have an extremely hard-line attitude, insisting that Hamas renounce violence and refusing to let it take part in the government while armed. </seg>
<seg id="30"> The leader of Hamas, Mashaal, emphasized on the 9th that armed resistance is the organization's "strategic choice". </seg>
<seg id="31"> The issue of weapons in reality includes two levels:  the legality of weapons and the administration of jurisdiction over armed forces. </seg>
<seg id="32"> That Hamas became the largest party in parliament through a democratic and free election has been recognized internationally. It will, through similarly legal methods, try to integrate its armed branch, the Al-Qassam Brigade, into the government's security apparatus. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Hamas has floated in the past the idea of unifying all the armed factions into a Palestinian national force, or "People's Army", but the idea was not widely acknowledged and was even criticize by the Palestine Islamic Jihad. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Palestine currently has 60,000 security personnel, the vast majority of which are from the Fatah camp. </seg>
<seg id="35"> In addition, Fatah also has some loose organizational ties to affiliated armed factions such as the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade and the Fatah Hawks. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Responsible for forming a cabinet, Hamas will have to come to terms with Fatah regarding how to manage these various self-governing armed groups and reasonably distribute power over the security administration. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> According to local media reports, Abbas wants to oversee the security and intelligence forces. The police and civil defense forces would be overseen by the internal affairs department of the new government. </seg>
<seg id="38"> But the various sides are still negotiating this sensitive issue and until now there have been no developments. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> TOKYO, February 13 (Xinhua)(Reporter: Qian Zheng) Researchers at Tokai University in Japan have developed a bioartificial kidney. It not only possesses the same catabolic functions as a human kidney, but at the same time is also able to retain useful material components. Additionally, it is small in size and easy to transplant. As more detailed research is carried out, there is hope that it could be good news for people with kidney disease. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> According to a recent report by the Japan Light Industry News, the newly developed bioartificial kidney consists primarily of two parts. One part is composed of "artificial nephrons" that filter metabolic matter and water from blood; the other part consists of the "artificial renal tubules" the extracts water, amino acids and other useful elements from the primary urine and returns them to the blood. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The artificial nephrons and the artificial renal tubules are all made from hollow silk thread. The inner wall of the artificial renal tubules is also covered with a layer of tubule epithelial cells capable of breaking down waste. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This kind of epithelial cell can cause the materials that lead to a disease stemming from chronic dialysis --dialysis-related amyloidosis-- to be broken down into amino acids and then returned to the blood. At the same time, it can also cause the glucose, vitamins and minerals needed by the body to reenter the blood. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In the past, artificial kidneys have relied on differences in osmotic pressure to filter metabolic waste but have been unable to eliminate it completely. They were also unable to return amino acids and other components to the blood. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The researchers conducted experimental transplants of the bioartificial kidney in goats. Epithelial cells from pigs were used to make the inner wall of the hollow threads of the artificial kidney. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Two weeks later, the researchers confirmed that the artificial kidney had successfully served its function. </seg>
<seg id="9"> They are currently developing a bioartificial kidney that uses human kidney cells and will conduct clinical studies after its safety has been verified. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Safe Electricity Production in China Still Faced with Difficult Challenges </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> BEIJING, Feb. 13 (Xinhua)(Reporter: An Pei) An official with the State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC) said on the 13th that although the safe production of electricity remained stable on the whole in 2005, it still faces difficult challenges. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> SERC Vice Chairman Shi Yubo said at the Fifth (Expanded) Meeting of the National Electricity Safe Production Committee held here that China's safe production of electric power was generally stable in 2005, with the task of supplying power during the peak summer period being satisfactorily fulfilled and the safe supply of power being realized. The impact of natural disasters was actively countered, thereby essentially ensuring the safe and stable operation of the electric power system. Accidents involving safe power production equipment or the general power grid showed a dramatic year-on-year reduction, while the health of power equipment was improved. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> But he also pointed out that changes in power supply and demand and the coming on line of a series of newly built power-generating systems implied new challenges for the safe production of electric power. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> These challenges include the following: electricity shortages will continue to exist on a region-specific, season-specific and time-specific basis; the supply of power remains stretched in some regions; major problems still exist in the supply of electricity and coal because of the lack of a positive mechanism for pricing them; at the same time, the worsening quality of coal has not yet been brought under effective control, seriously affecting the stable operation of power-generating sets; the weak structure and outdated equipment of some power grids cause hidden problems in system safety; the frequent occurrence of accidents in the construction of electric power infrastructure has not been turned around and the situation remains grave. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Shi Yubo said contradictions buried at deeper levels will continuously be exposed as reform permeates further into the electric power system. The new problem faced will be how to maintain stability within employee ranks and ensure normal, orderly production. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Discussing about the safe production of electric power in 2006, Shi Yubo said it was necessary to further strengthen basic initiatives for the management of safe power production; speed up the establishment and improvement of the emergency control mechanism for electricity safety and enhance emergency reaction capabilities; step up coordination and team work between plants and grids in the joint maintenance of the safety of the electricity system; continue a high standard of safety supervision and informatization efforts for hydroelectric dams in order to ensure dam safety; tighten control over safety in electricity-related construction work so as to reduce casualties; and continue to reinforce the submission of information to ensure the accuracy, timeliness and smooth communication of electricity safety information. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> According to reports, in keeping with the new situation in electricity safety management, CERC will this year revise and improve the already promulgated Interim Regulations on Investigations into Electricity Production Accidents. At the same time, CERC will also issue support documents concerning the safety of hydroelectric dams and the safety protection of secondary electricity systems this year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The power consumption of Chinese society in 2005 reached 2.4689 trillion KWH, registering a year-on-year rise of 13.45%. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Confronted with the tautness of power supply and prominent difficulties in the transportation of coals and fuels, electric power enterprises took effective measures to improve equipment management so that all last year no major equipment accident occurred in the national electricity production . </seg>
<seg id="11"> There were 74 power grid accidents, representing a year-on-year decrease of 127, and 427 equipment accidents, for a year-on-year decrease of 132. </seg>

<seg id="3"> He also said the South African government would do everything possible to "fight all forms of criminal activity." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Vusi B. Koloane said that the South African government hopes to "reduce the crime rate to zero" and wants the safety of the lives and property of every foreigner working in South Africa to be fully guaranteed by the local law and citizens. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> So far, four Chinese citizens have been murdered in South Africa in 2006, causing a widespread expression of concern from the Chinese community. </seg>
<seg id="6"> China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has raised the issue with South Africa and warned Chinese citizens traveling to South Africa to be more aware of safety precautions. It also called on overseas compatriots to strengthen unity and friendly care between themselves while also coordinating with police in fighting crime. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "We express our sincerest sympathies and condolences to the families of those killed." </seg>
<seg id="8"> Vusi B. Koloane said, "We feel sorry for what has happened and ask the Chinese people to believe that the government of South Africa is thoroughly investigating every case involving Chinese." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> According to the Chinese embassy in South Africa, South African police have successfully solved the case of Chen Jianqing, a woman from Fujian, China who was murdered in South Africa on February 5. One suspect has been arrested. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Police are currently hunting another suspect. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Furthermore, the South African embassy in China has revealed that South African police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of a Hong Kong businessman in January this year and that the victim's possessions have been recovered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Speaking of the impact that the killing of Chinese citizens might have, Vusi B. Koloane said that the incidents would "definitely" have a negative impact on business, tourism and other areas of interaction between the two countries, but the impact would "probably be fairly small" in the long run. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> According to Manqoba Nyembezi, tourism attache with the South African embassy in China, the South African embassy issued more than 2,000 visas to Chinese nationals in the first 15 days of this year. </seg>
<seg id="14"> According to official Chinese statistics, South Africa continued to remain China's largest trade partner in Africa in 2005. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Bilateral trade grew 23% year-on-year to US$7.27bn. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> However, tourism industry sources said the serial killings of Chinese citizens in South Africa in 2004 had a marked influence on the number of tourists traveling to South Africa. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Statistics from the South African Tourism Board show that 20,331 Chinese tourists visited South Africa in the first half of 2005, representing a year-on-year decrease of 14.9%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Approximately 200,000 Chinese currently live in South Africa. They are spread throughout South Africa's cities, town and villages. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Analysts here have attributed the consistently high rate of crime to the large wealth gap in South African society, high unemployment, the rampant use of guns and the lack of a death penalty to serve as a deterrent. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Because many Chinese do not understand English, they keep cash on their person and in their homes, making is easier to become the target of an attack by criminals seeking money. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> BEIJING, Feb. 15 (Xinhua)(Reporter:  Li Jiangtao) After days of intensive arrangements, the mourning hall for Academician Wang Xuan set up in the Centennial Lecture Hall of Beijing University formally opened at 9:00 on the 15th. By noon, hundreds of people had come to pay their last respects. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> By just after 8:00, before the morning hall was scheduled to open, scores of people had lined up outside the door. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In the Centennial Lecture Hall of Beijing University, this reporter saw a black banner hanging on the wall. It read  "Profound Grieving for Academician Wang Xuan". </seg>
<seg id="5"> Below the banner was a huge funerary portrait more than ten square meters in size. In it, he wore glasses and had a slight smile, reflecting his refined temperament. </seg>
<seg id="6"> On both sides of the funerary portrait stood several cypresses. Scores of wreaths were lined up on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="7"> On one of the wreaths, an elegiac couple read "Chinese printing originated in Qin and flourished in the Tang. Contributed to the replacement of letter printing with electronic printing". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Funeral music resounded in the morning hall, adding to the heavy and solemn atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In the crowd of mourners were the leaders, teachers and students of Beijing University, as well as friends, colleagues, students and neighbors of Wang Xuan. Many people who had never met him also made a special effort to come. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Some held flowers in their hands and some carried flower baskets. Each person wore a small white flower on his chest. They walked slowly up to the portrait of Academician Wang Xuan and bowed in a show of mourning. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Many could not hold back their tears. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Zhang Wenbin, former director of the State Administration of Cultural Heritage, is an alumni of Beijing University. He told this reporter that, over a decade ago, when he was working in Henan Province, Professor Wang Xuan submitted a report on scientific and technological innovation to the cadres of the Provincial Party Committee on invitation. </seg>
<seg id="13"> "Academician Wang Xuan is a model we should learn from in both conduct and pursuit of studies. He made significant contributions to the state and society. People will never forget him." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Professor Jin Ruilin of the Law School of Beijing University was an old friend and neighbor of Wang Xuan for more than 40 years. </seg>
<seg id="15"> He was released from hospital only days ago and insisted on coming today to bid farewell to his old friend. </seg>
<seg id="16"> When leaving his words in the visitor's book, Mr. Jin could not hold back his sorrow and took out a tissue several times to wipe away his tears. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> He told this reporter that Professor Wang Xuan lived a very simple life. "When he moved into Dongfu Garden, he was already a professor with significant achievements. But he still lived for years in a very small apartment." </seg>
<seg id="18"> Later, he moved to Chengze Garden and again lived for over a decade in an apartment that was 70~80m2. </seg>
<seg id="19"> He would not accept the large apartment measuring more than 140m2 in Lanqiying that Beijing University assigned to him nor the apartment in the highrise Fangzheng Building. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> With deep feelings, Mr. Jin recalled that, during his visit abroad, Wang Xuan was offered very generous remuneration to stay on, but he resolutely declined. </seg>
<seg id="21"> "At first, he adamantly refused to apply for academician status. It was only after Mr. Zhou Peiyuan made several attempts at persuasion in person that Wang Xuan went to complete the form." </seg>
<seg id="22"> What moved Mr. Jin the most was Wang Xuan's attitude toward training young people. "He repeatedly emphasized that the assessment of his own success depended not on his own achievements, but on what he had done to train young people." </seg>
<seg id="23"> According to Mr. Jin, Wang Xuan began to pay attention to training of young people after he had entered into his fifties. He consistently stressed his desire to pave the way for young people and give way to them. </seg>
<seg id="24"> "This is not easy for a successful scientist." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> This reporter learned from Beijing University Press Center that the mourning hall would be open to the public from 9:00 to 16:00 on February 15 through to February 19 at 12:00 in order that people of all walks of life can express their condolences. </seg>

<seg id="1"> China to Issue Information Network Transmission Right Protection Regulations </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> BEIJING, February 15 (Xinhua) (Reporters: Zhou Wei, Li Fei) Many websites rely on large-scale retransmission of news reports from newspapers and magazines to increase hits. But many have not been authorized to do so and have not paid any fees. To counter this, said Director-General of the Copyright Department of the National Copyright Administration Wang Ziqiang at a news conference held by the State Council on the 15th, the State Council's impending Information Network Transmission Right Protection Regulations will respond to the issue of fees for the transmission of Internet works. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Wang Ziqiang said that according to the laws and regulations currently in effect, works already published in a newspaper or magazine, if an author fails to make a "Not for Use" declaration, magazines and newspapers can use the work without the author's permission but at the same time be required to pay remuneration. In accordance with the provisions of rules and regulations, the State Copyright Bureau has specially formulated remuneration standards for retransmission of newspapers and magazines. </seg>
<seg id="4"> However, according to the laws and regulations currently in effect, while newspapers and magazine have the legal right to require authorization, Internet sites do not have the same right. </seg>
<seg id="5"> According to a related judicial interpretation by the Supreme People's Court, the method in which the legal right to require authorization is applied to newspapers and magazines can be applied to the Internet, so that short articles published in newspapers, magazines and on the Internet can be used on the Internet without acquiring permission if the author has not made a "Do Not Use" declaration, with the user being required to pay remuneration. </seg>
<seg id="6"> But because the judicial interpretation does not make any stipulations regarding remuneration standards, in practice no remuneration is being paid when these works are used on the Internet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "On the issue of whether legal authorization applies to the use on the Internet of short articles that have already been published, this still needs to be determined at the legal level." </seg>
<seg id="8"> Wang Ziqiang said: "Whether or not it is to be included within a scope determined by law, it is still necessary to wait for the Information Network Transmission Protection Regulations to be issued this year in order to make a confirmation. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> MOSCOW, Feb. 15 (Xinhua)(Reporter: Song Shiyi) Russian Defense Ministry press official [Xiedufu] told media during a statement on the 15th that the Georgian parliament's resolution on Russian peacekeepers would not affect the Russian military's peacekeeping in the short term and that Russian forces would continue to carry out peacekeeping and their mission in the South Ossetia conflict region. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> In a statement the same day regarding the Georgian parliament's resolution concerning Russia's peacekeeping forces, Kokoshin, chairman of Russian State Duma (the lower house of parliament) Committee on the Commonwealth of Independent States, said that the resolution by Georgia would undo the stability in the current state of affairs in the region and would be detrimental to Russo-Georgian relations. </seg>
<seg id="4"> He stressed the Georgian parliament's resolution was a step that would once again take Russo-Georgian relations in a negative direction. </seg>
<seg id="5"> He said Georgia's accusations toward Russia were preposterous. </seg>

<seg id="8"> The Georgian parliament called on the government to take active measures and consider bringing international peacekeepers into the South Ossetia conflict area to replace Russian peacekeeping in the region. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> CHANGCHUN, February 16 (Xinhua) (Reporter: Zhou Liquan) Following a large fire in a hospital in the city of Liaoyuan in Jilin province, an accident investigation team has determined eleven individuals to be responsible. These include the supervisor of the electrician team, Zhang Diankun, and four other individuals who will be prosecuted for gross negligence. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> On December 15, 2005, a fire at the largest hospital in Liaoyuan, the Central Hospital, resulted in 39 deaths. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The fire covered an area of more than 5000 square meters. </seg>
<seg id="5"> According to reports, it was the largest fire to occur in the national healthcare system since the foundation of new China. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> An investigation has revealed that the incident began on that day at approximately 1630hrs when electricity to the Liaoyuan Central Hospital suddenly stopped. According to the hospital's circuitry design, if power is cut, the switch in the transformer box automatically activates a backup switch that maintains the normal supply of power to the hospital. In this case, the backup switch failed to automatically activate and Electrician Team Supervisor Zhang Diankun forced the resumption of power without checking the cause of the outage. This resulted in the fire. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Furthermore, there were more than ten cables that were tangled together among the underground electrical cables that were giving off smoke. This kind of electrical cable should be neatly arranged and a fire protection layer should be installed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> For this reason, three other individual will also be prosecuted for gross negligence: 57-year-old Zhao Yongchun, electrical installation team supervisor at the Liaoyuan Textile Company; Sun Fenglin, a retired official (senior engineer) for the Liaoyuan Electricity Bureau; and Jin Chengtai, retired employee of the Liaoyuan Central Hospital who was later rehired. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> BEIJING, February 16 (Xinhua)(Reporter: Chen Jianxing) The economic administration authorities of the Taiwan government decided on the 15th to fine United Microelectronics Corporations (UMC)--one of the "two titans of Taiwan's chip industry"--NT$5 million for "unlawfully aiding and participating in the establishment" of He Jian Technology in mainland China. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Taiwan's China Times reported that this is the first time Taiwan authorities have penalized a Taiwanese business for investing in the mainland since Chen Shui-bian came up with a stance of advocating a cross-strait economic policy of "active management, effective liberalization". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to the report, individuals attached to the Investment Commission of Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs said UMC was fined because it had violated the Statute Governing Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area as well as the Measures Governing Investment or Technical Cooperation in Mainland China. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The Investment Commission will fine UMC's former chairman Tsao Hsing-Cheng and others after reviewing the situation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The "UMC Case" began in February, 2005, when Taiwanese investigators sent nearly a hundred people to raid the homes and offices of several UMC executives, saying UMC was suspected of "illegally providing funds, technology and human resources" to Hejian Technology, a mainland company in which UMC had invested. </seg>
<seg id="7"> UMC's chairman at the time, Tsao Hsing-Cheng, publicly stated after the event that UMC had not breached any of the Taiwan government's regulations and that UMC's help to Hejian Technology was in UMC's long-term interest because UMC would lose business opportunities if it failed to quickly enter the mainland market. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Afterwards, the Taiwan government's Financial Supervisory Commission fined UMC NT$3 million for contravening regulations on the disclosure of business information. </seg>
<seg id="9"> UMC's board accepted Tsao Hsing-Cheng's resignation on January 9, 2006. A few hours later, Tsao Hsing-Cheng was officially indicted for alleged illegal investment in the mainland. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> JINAN, February 17 (Xinhua)(Zhang Yuqing, Shen Yaoqin) Jinan Military District Cardiovascular Research Institute recently performed successful heart transplant surgery on an infant. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In the Intensive Care Unit on the 17th, reporters saw that the infant's face was plump and red 51 days after the surgery and all monitoring and prognostic indicators were normal. He had smoothly passed through the critical period of the surgery and was now cheerfully playing with toys bought for him by hospital staff. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The doctor examining him that day explained that when the sick infant from the rural district of Tai'An in Shandong was brought to the hospital by his parents, his entire body was blue and purple and he was having difficulty breathing. Following a medical examination, he was diagnosed as suffering from cyanotic congenital heart disease that would require a heart transplant. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Heart transplant surgery is the most difficult, risky and complicated of all heart surgeries. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This is especially true when it involves a heart transplant in an infant under one year old, something that had never been done in China. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The Jinan Military District Cardiovascular Research Institute organized specialists who  deliberated into the night, meticulously designing a surgical and post-operative-monitoring plan. They devised innovations of their own in the method of vascular anastomosis and carried out tests on animals. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> At 8:00 a.m. on December 28, 2005, the surgery officially began. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The donor heart came from an infant that had died after sudden respiratory-and-heart failure caused by a congenital lung malformation. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The surgery required the anastomosis of six arteries and more than 510 sutures, with the distance between sutures not exceeding 3mm. </seg>
<seg id="11"> After 295 minutes, the surgery was a complete success. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> BEIJING, Feb. 17 (Xinhua)(Reporter: Liu Zheng) Following a string of four mining disasters that took the lives of over one hundred people, the grim status of national production safety over the past year has made "curbing major and extraordinary coal mine accidents" the most urgent task in national work safety this year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> This reporter was informed on the 17th by the State Administration of Work Safety that coal mines must be given top priority if major and extraordinary coal mine accidents are truly going to be curbed. </seg>
<seg id="4"> To make coal mines safer this year, the State Administration of Work Safety will take a strong hold over the following three items: </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> --Continue to wage an aggressive fight to control gas. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Control of gas this year must give prominence to "draining gas before mining coal". </seg>
<seg id="7"> If high gassy mines fail to "drain gas before mining coal", they will be legally ordered to immediately halt production. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> --Continue to wage an aggressive fight to consolidate and close mines. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The 5243 coal-mine and coal-pit closures already announced to the public must be carried out one by one, as must the more than seven hundred other closures recently announced in various regions. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Closures must become a part of routine work, with coal mines that destroy resources, pollute the environment and fail to meet safety requirements being shut down without relent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> --Strengthen administration of coal-mine safety infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The deterioration of management in the small number of large state-owned mines must immediately be corrected and controlled, while small mines with disorganized management should be guided in the building of standardized safety management systems. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In particular, key state-owned mines should be tightly controlled in order to strictly prohibit production in excess of capacity, strength or manpower. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The safe production control standard for this year calls for a 3% drop over last year in the number of deaths nationally from all types of accidents, including a 3.5% drop in accidents in coal mines. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Major accidents with a death toll higher than ten must decrease at least 5%, while in the coal mines they must decrease 7%. </seg>
<seg id="16"> These control standards have been transmitted to the people's governments of the various provinces. The various regions are breaking them up into their various layers and implementing them at the grassroots and enterprise levels. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Statistics show that nationally 5986 people were killed in coal mine accidents in 2005, which represents a 0.7% decrease year on year. </seg>
<seg id="18"> But there were more large accidents in which ten or more people were killed, with the number of deaths increasing 66.6% year on year. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> After holding separate talks that day with Kosovo Provisional Authority President Sejdiu, Kosovo ethnic Serb representatives and others, Barroso told media that the various sides in Kosovo should maintain a tolerant attitude and build a democratic and multiethnic Kosovo, since only a Kosovo that respects the authority of the government and protects the interests of minorities will be recognized by the international community. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> TURIN, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) News Analysis: Pyleva Incident Likely to End Unsettled </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> (Reporters: Gao Peng, Ding Ying) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Italy has reiterated on several occasions that all athletes found doping during the Turin Winter Olympics could face a "prison term", but judging from things as they stand now, chances are slim that this will happen to Russian biathlete Olga Pyleva, leading figure in the first doping scandal of these Winter Olympics. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> On the 16th, the Turin Winter Olympics saw its first doping scandal uncovered when Olga Pyleva was found to have used carphedron, a banned drug. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The following day, the International Olympic Committee announced that Pyleva had been expelled from the Winter Olympics and stripped of the silver medal she won for the women's 15km individual biathlon at these Winter Olympics. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The same day, the International Winter Biathlon Union decided to ban her from competition for two years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> It has been a consistent rule of the International Olympic Committee that any athlete found to have used performance-enhancing drugs at an Olympics Games will have his or her result cancelled and be disqualified from participation, but will receive no legal penalty. </seg>
<seg id="9"> But under Italian law, athletes commit a crime by carrying and using stimulants. Judicial authorities have the power to directly arrest and investigate all athletes that use performance-enhancing drugs and punish violators with prison terms ranging from three months to three years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> In December last year, after one year of "bargaining", the International Olympic Committee and the Italian government finally reached an accord under which the two sides agreed to handle incidents involving doping athletes during this Winter Olympics in accordance with Italian laws. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Following unremitting efforts by the International Olympic Committee, Italian authorities conceded four days before the opening of the Winter Olympics to a promise that police would not enter the Olympic Village to search athletes' dwellings during the Winter Olympic Games. But athletes whose drug test proves positive will still be subject to investigation by Italian prosecutors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Reports say that Pescante, the Italian government official supervising the Turin Winter Olympics, had referred the Pyleva doping incident to prosecutors in Turin. </seg>
<seg id="13"> But neither the International Olympic Committee nor Pescante himself has yet confirmed the report. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Russian biathlon team doctor Andrey Dmytriev disclosed at noon on the 17th that Pyleva had left Turin to return to her country. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Shi Kangcheng, a Chinese sports official who worked for years in the World Anti-doping Agency, said that once Pyleva returned home the case would very likely end up unsettled. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Shi Kangcheng added that the International Olympic Committee and the Italian government had never been "thorough" in their anti-doping drive at the Winter Olympics and the outcome would be hard to predict even if Italian prosecutors did step in. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Based on past instances of punishment handed down to Italian athletes that have used performance-enhancing drugs, the harshest punishment imposed on violators was no more than "two years of prison term served on probation". </seg>
<seg id="18"> For this reason, senior reporter of Italy's ANSA [pei ai]predicted that the possibility of Pyleva going to prison was "exceedingly slim" and that a fine would be the most she would receive. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> also said  that although an Italian court can pass judgment in absentia, it would be impossible for the Italian police to bring her back from a foreign country for a prison term. </seg>
<seg id="20"> If Pyleva refused to accept a judgment, there would be no way Italian authorities could detain her. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> BEIJING, Feb. 18 (Xinhua) Bird flu has spread further on the African continent, says a summary report by a Xinhua overseas reporter. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The World Heath Organization (WHO) confirmed on the 17th that birds killed by the bird flu virus have been found in three regions in Egypt. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In Europe, the H5 bird flu virus has also been found in France for the first time. Europe and Africa are on high alert and are strengthening anti-epidemic measures. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Hasan al-Bushra, advisor to the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region, said that at present dead birds infected with the H5N1 bird flu virus have been discovered in  Cairo and Giza in central Egypt and three areas in Minya in the country's south. The responsible departments of the Egyptian government have begun to slaughter domestic fowl that could be infected with bird flu. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Experts say that Egypt is an important passage for migratory birds traveling to the Middle East and North Africa, so it is very likely that the bird flu virus was brought into the country by migrating birds. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Egypt has announced a ban on live fowl imports and will reinforce quarantine inspections at border entries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> A poultry farm in Cameroon's capital Yaounde saw more than 800 birds die in the past week. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Cameroon has decided to call an immediate temporary halt to all imports of fowl and pork from Nigeria, where bird flu has occurred. It also called a temporary halt to the trade of fowl and related products in all markets in the border area between the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="10"> With little delay, Cameroon's government also set up an epidemic monitoring network covering the entire border. The country's Pasteur Center and the National Veterinary Laboratory are also on an on-call state of alert so that laboratory tests related to the H5N1 virus can be initiated at any time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> In Europe, Denmark and Sweden preliminarily ruled out the presence of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Laboratory test results released by Sweden's National Veterinary Institute show that the Swedish swans found dead Wednesday were not infected with the bird flu virus. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Preliminary laboratory results by Denmark's National Veterinary Administration have also indicated that thirty dead swans found recently within Denmark's borders were not infected with the bird flu virus. </seg>
<seg id="14"> But the Department of Agriculture said that Denmark cannot yet lower its guard. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Romania in Eastern Europe has had nine bird flu outbreaks so far this year. A WHO expert said on the 17th in Bucharest that almost every area in the Danube Delta region has seen cases of bird flu and that the situation must be treated seriously, adding that Romania may continually be threatened by bird flu over the next three to five years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> In Asia, the government of Bangladesh has taken all necessary measures to prevent bird flu. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The government's Department of Livestock Services has provided books on the prevention of bird flu to relevant officials and at the same time has organized training for poultry farmers. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> BEIJING, February 18 (Xinhua) The Blood Center of Zhejiang Province has revealed that China's first blood supply data management and control network system recently was formally established at the center in recent days and put online. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> An official from the Blood Center of Zhejiang Province said that this means that from now on when any citizen in any county (municipality, district) in Zhejiang Province donates blood at an organization that supplies and collects blood, there will be a unique record number. When he donates blood again, the corresponding record number just needs to be entered and information such as personal data, blood type, blood donation records, date of last blood donation and whether blood donation is permitted will immediately appear. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The official explained further that if when the corresponding record number is entered the system says the required period between blood donation is not yet over, it will indicate conditions to donate blood on this occasion have not been met. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This will not only help protect the health of the blood donor, but will also help protect the health and safety of the blood user. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Futhermore, when blood supply is limited, blood donors and their families will have a preferential right to blood. You only need to enter a valid blood donor ID and the blood donors data will immediately appear. It is extremely convenient. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> According to a report in Hangzhou's Today Morning Express, the data system is now being used in 36 organizations that collect and supply blood throughout the province. The blood resource status of the province's organizations that collect and supply blood can also be shown immediately, making it possible for the data to be used throughout the province. </seg>

<seg id="3"> Actor Philip Seymour Hoffman of the film "Capote," widely regarding as having the best hope of taking this year's Oscar, revealed that when he was young and wild he wallowed in the clutches of drugs and alcohol with no way to escape; luckily he later succeeded in rehabilitation, allowing him to begin the peak of his acting career. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Hoffman sighed when doing an interview with America's CBS news magazine "60 minutes" that during that period he truly used whatever means necessary to obtain drugs and alcohol. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> At the time he was just over 20, and had just graduated from the drama department of New York University when he entered into a rich and varied society; the pace of everyday life revolved rapidly, finally revolving until his head swelled and spun, and he lost control. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> When he was 22 years old he entered a drug rehabilitation clinic and got rid of his habits of heavy drinking and popping pills there; that was the most panic stricken period of his life. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In the fast approaching Oscar Awards Ceremony to be held next month, Hoffman interprets the character of American writer Capote in the movie "Capote," and is considered the favorite to take home the award for best actor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Long before this, his exquisite acting had already been confirmed, as he had already received the confirmation via many awards, including a Golden Globe for best actor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> This 38-year-old actor expressed during the interview that if he did not make the painful decision to change his bad habits before becoming famous, he probably wouldn't have received a nomination for an Oscar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> He said that he greatly admires those 19-year-old rich and beautiful actors who become famous all at once. </seg>

<seg id="1"> New Regulations for Chinese Electronic Banking Services to be Implemented Beginning March 1. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News February 6 from Beijing (reporters Han Jie and Xu Bo).  The reporters have learned from the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) that the "Administrative Methods on Electronic Banking" and "Guidelines on Electronic Banking Security Evaluation " the CBRC has released will be implemented on February 1, 2006. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> A spokesperson for the CBRC said that according to the stipulations of the administrative methods, the relevant examination and approval methods of foreign capital financial organizations has basically not changed.  Even after branches of foreign banks obtain approval to open online bank services, if they need to add new online banking services the main reporting branch bank within the borders of China should carry out notification and evaluation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> To standardize the utilization of the Internet for banking services by commercial banks, the People's Bank of China formulated and issued the "Temporary Methods for Online Banking Administration." </seg>
<seg id="5"> The spokesperson for the CBRC said that with the continuous development of electronic banking services among commercial banks, the temporary methods can no longer accommodate the needs of electronic banking risk supervision, therefore the CBRC formulated these two new regulations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> According to their spokesperson, the CBRC's firm belief in the qualification of security evaluation institutions is different from the administrative approval of qualification characteristics of industry or enterprise admittance.  It is not that the evaluation institutions are opening up required conditions for banking security evaluation, it's just a reference for financial institutions to select evaluation institutions with. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> As long as security evaluation institutions are in accordance with the relevant conditions and demands, even if they have not had their qualifications recognized by the CBRC, financial institutions can still use them to implement electronic banking security evaluation, but they should carry out management according to the relevant regulations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The "Administrative Methods on Electronic Banking" has 99 articles in 9 chapters. It is divided into General Provisions, Application and Modifications, Risk Management, Data Exchange and Transfer Management, Outsourcing Management, Cross-border Business Management, Supervision and Regulation Management, Legal Liability and Supplementary Provisions. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The "Electronic Banking Security Evaluation Guidelines" has 57 articles in 5 chapters. It is divided into General Provisions, Security Evaluation Institutions, Implementation of Security Evaluation, Security Evaluation Management and Supplementary Provisions. </seg>

<seg id="1"> (Selected Best of Newspapers and Periodicals) Shanghai: Persons with Concurrent Jobs and Graduates of Institutions of Higher Education Become Main Force of Hourly Wage Earners. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News February 7 from Beijing. Shanghai Municipal Ministry of Labor and Social Security announced its 'Guide to Minimum Hourly Wages for 2006' on February 6.  The number of jobs covered reached 120, 11 more than last time.  Wages for these jobs saw some increases and some decreases. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> According to the estimations of relevant experts at the Shanghai Municipal Ministry of Labor and Social Security, Shanghai already has over one million people who work for hourly wages. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to a report in "China Youth Magazine," graduates from institutions of higher education and people holding concurrent jobs (holding two or more jobs at once) are the main constituencies making up the ranks that work for hourly wages. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Through direct surveying of nearly 8000 hourly paying jobs, it was found that over half of those surveyed hold concurrent jobs.  The proportion of this group reaches 51.1% of the whole. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The level of culture of concurrent job holders is usually fairly high, they mainly are employed in jobs with relatively strong technical natures, such as translation positions where the proportion of concurrent laborers is as high as 81.7%, and fitness areas where the proportion reaches 61.6%. </seg>
<seg id="7"> A high income is one important reason that many people are engaged in concurrent hourly paying jobs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> According to our understanding, some positions have monthly incomes that can reach several tens of thousands of RMB, such as some hard to fill positions like simultaneous interpretation.  The majority of hourly positions have monthly incomes reaching 2000 RMB or more, such as those concurrent positions in financial affairs, wedding masters of ceremonies, and so on. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Satisfying personal interests and expanding one's knowledge is also an important reason that receives the attention of those holding concurrent jobs with hourly wages. </seg>
<seg id="10"> For example, Mr. Gu, who holds the position of manager of the Human Resources Department of a certain enterprise, will take a few hours of time every week to handle the financial accounts of the representative office of a certain foreign business. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Mr. Gu believes that the biggest benefit of concurrent jobs is that it allows his knowledge to continually receive updates, and he has opportunities to be involved in another area.  Of course, a monthly income of 2000 RMB also has a certain attraction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Because some hourly positions have low employment thresholds, the circumstances of the jobs are flexible and free and have progressively received the attention of many graduates currently looking for positions.  Among those making hourly wages, 14% are university or technical school graduates of the past three years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> "At first I didn't want to work for hourly wages, but after a few months, I think it's better than going to work from nine to five." </seg>
<seg id="14"> After college student Huang graduated, the job she found wasn't very ideal.  Finally she registered her name with a hotel to play background music on the piano. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "I am very satisfied with my current job.  I make 100 RMB an hour, and the environment is good, what I want to do now is find more hourly wage jobs." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> According to our understanding, hourly wage work has already become an important path for graduates to accumulate work experience, exercise their working skills, increase their communication techniques, and grow social experiences. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Graduates doing hourly work are mainly concentrated on positions with relatively strong technical and intellectual natures, such as translation positions and similar positions with relatively high professional natures and highly era-stylistic performance art positions.  Their proportion of hourly wages is 22.1% and 26.8% respectively. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Some hourly work positions have lower technical skills, such as food sales promoter and tally clerks.  Unemployed persons can begin working these positions with only simple training. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The data shows that the proportion of people working hourly wage jobs that were originally unemployed reaches 39%, among which retail jobs have a proportion as high as 68.4% of workers that were unemployed, and a proportion of 58.7% among food and beverage jobs.  Hourly wage jobs have become an important channel for the unemployed. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Chinese Expert: America Beating Drum of 'Chinese Military Threat' is Irrational Criticism </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua New February 9 from Beijing (reporters Li Xuanliang, Xiong Zhengyan, and Lin Liping)  The Pentagon's "Quadrennial Defense Review Report" formally handed over to Congress in recent days has for the first time referred to China as 'the newly rising major nation most likely to present a military challenge to America'. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Experts believe this is an irrational criticism of China's normal defense construction, a dramatization of the 'Chinese military threat theory', and is an interference in China's internal affairs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The "Quadrennial Defense Review Report" is the Pentagon's new national defense policy paper. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This 92 page long report uses three sections to discuss the problem of Chinese military force and what paths America should take to meet this problem.  The report directly brings up 'China' or 'Chinese' a total of 15 times, saying 'as a major and newly prosperous large nation, China has the most potential to carry out military competition with America.  If America does not have counter-measures, China will likely develop destructive military technologies, thus breaking America's advantage in conventional weapons.' </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Researcher Yao Yunzhu of the World Military Research Department of the China Military Science Institute says that, although high level American officials have expressed similar views many times before, this is the first time America put forward that 'China is the newly rising major country most likely to present a military challenge to America' in its 'defense strategy reports'. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> 'This report for the first time clearly takes Russia, India, and China as newly rising strategic opponents, among which it especially gives even more consideration to the so called Chinese military threat theory.' </seg>
<seg id="8"> Said Major General Peng Guangqian, researcher of the China Military Science Institute. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Worth noting is that on the same day that the "Quadrennial Defense Review Report" was formally handed in, American President Bush also handed to Congress the government budget for fiscal year 2007, in which the defense budget reached 439.3 billion USD. </seg>
<seg id="10"> 'If you add on to this the budget for the military movements in Iraq and Afghanistan, America's 2007 fiscal year defense budget will breakthrough 500 billion USD, setting a new historic high' Peng Guangqian said. 'This is nearly equal to the total military expenditures of all other countries in the world put together.' </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Peng Guangqian believes that the method of America concocting 'threat theories from other countries' reflects the Pentagon's usual style of 'creating enemies.'  Its real aim is in striving for even more defense expenditures, and dredging up even more profits for America's huge military industrial complex. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Experts say, compared with America's huge military expenditures, China's defense expenditures are relatively limited. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Military expert Deng Hongzhou, who has taken part in the writing of China's Defense White Paper several times, said that since the 1990's, along with economic development, China's defense expenditures have increased, but have shown a declining trend in the total proportion of national revenue expenditures of the same period. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Official data shows that in 2004 as compared to 1979, China's defense expenditures fell by ten percentage points in terms of the proportion of national revenue expenditures of the same period. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In 2005, China's defense expenditures were 244.656 billion RMB, equal to only approximately 1/14 of America's.  Average per capita military expenditures are only equal to about 1/60 of America's.  Per capita spending on military personnel is only equal to approximately 1/30 of America's. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> 'America's land area is about equal to China's land area, but military expenditures of the two countries have a huge difference.  It is self evident which country has military strength that exceeds its normal defense needs.' </seg>
<seg id="17"> Peng Guangqian said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Teng Jianqun, Director of the Research Department of China's Military Control and Disarmament Association, expressed that America should objectively appraise the situation of China's military construction. China's peaceful development does not mean that China and America will become military opponents in the future. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The "China's Defense in 2004" White Paper said China staunchly follows the path of peaceful development, and carries out a defensive national defense policy. </seg>
<seg id="20"> China has never become a threat to any country in the past or present, and will not become a threat in the future. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Up until now, China has not established military bases in any country, and has not sent one soldier to any other country, while America has over 100 military bases abroad, and in the Asian Pacific region alone has in excess of 100,000 military forces deployed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Professor Zhu Feng of Beijing University's International Relations Institute said that China and America should go through already established channels to increase communication and exchanges, increase understanding and mutual trust, comprehensively further Chinese and American constructive cooperative relations in the new century and jointly promote maintaining world peace and development. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News February 9 from Ramallah (Internationl Observation). Hamas Looks for Breakthrough in Forming Cabinet </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Xinhua News reporter Hao Huangmin </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> After the Palestine Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) obtained victory in legislative elections, how it will paint a blueprint for a new government has become a focal point the whole world is concerned with at the moment. </seg>
<seg id="5"> What kinds of new policies Hamas will put forth will directly influence the direction taken by all concerned parties in corresponding policy for the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="6"> At the same time, the attitude of resistance of America and Israel adds even more variables to the prospects of the Hamas government. </seg>
<seg id="7"> At present, various Palestinian factions are currently tightening their cooperation, and are actively searching for breakthroughs on the future development of the situation on sensitive points and difficulties that forming a cabinet involves. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> (Sub Heading) Who Will the Position of Premier Fall to? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> After Hamas obtained the right to form the cabinet, there have been people in the outside world who worry a 'Hamas Premier' will likely see differently than the current high leader Abbas. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Also, Hamas leader Mashal, who is currently visiting Egypt, emphasized that the new Palestinian government established by Hamas leaders will not continue to recognize Israel.  This intransigent standpoint also intensifies the worry of the international community. </seg>
<seg id="11"> America and Israel explicitly state they will not accept a Hamas government that controls real power, and have used this threat to cut off economic support and transmission of taxation to Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="12"> However, this has not obstructed Hamas in making flexible policy adjustments - choosing independents is a policy to split the difference. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> According to reports, to acquire international approval across the largest range possible, earlier domestic and foreign Hamas leaders meeting together in Egypt decided to choose independent Ismail Haniyeh, Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Islamic University in Gaza, to be appointed the new premier. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This move has still not received the responses of concerned parties. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Palestine Analyst Hussein said that no matter who the position of premier falls to, what is most crucial is the choice for premier must dilute the 'hard' aspects of Hamas as much as possible.  Only by doing this can the successful forming of a cabinet be secured. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> (Sub Heading) How to Allocate Power </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Looking at the internal makeup of the party, the biggest challenge that Hamas faces in forming a cabinet is it lacks ample experience being in power. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The Palestine "Daily" published an analysis saying that while Hamas gathered popularity through social welfare projects, in the area of being in power it lacks experience.  Hamas cooperating with the Palestinian National Liberation Movement (Fatah), which has experience being in power, would be the best strategy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Hamas brought up establishing a 'government partner' relationship with Fatah after the elections to jointly establish a united ethnic government, however Fatah has not given a positive response to this as of the present. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Opinions among those in the Fatah party as to whether or not to enter the cabinet are not the same.  One faction advocates participating in the new government, and thus having something to say; another faction refuses the invitation of Hamas, and would rather be an 'active opposition faction' in the legislature. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Persons with sensitive information pointed out that under the advice of Abbas, Fatah is progressively leaning towards entering into the new government. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Although this might be the case, Hamas and Fatah would still haggle over the allocation of cabinet positions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Besides this, another path would be to establish a cabinet that is free of party affiliations and outside the framework of the legislature. </seg>
<seg id="24"> According to reports, Hamas has also designed a technocracy government, but the concrete list of names is still unknown. </seg>
<seg id="25"> In light of the attitude of Israel and America, a technocracy government might still be accepted as a method to form a cabinet that would lessen outside pressure. </seg>
<seg id="26"> According to regulations of the Palestine "Basic Law," after the new legislature convenes on the February 16, the nominations for premier and forming of a cabinet will be completed in three to five weeks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> (Sub Heading) At a Loss About Armed Forces </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The weapons in the hands of Hamas are another thorny problem that the forming of a new government faces. </seg>
<seg id="29"> America's and Israel's attitude is extremely stiff.  They staunchly demand Hamas give up violence, and reject Hamas taking part in government while carrying guns. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Hamas leader Mashal emphasized on February 9 that armed resistance is the 'strategic choice' of his organization. </seg>
<seg id="31"> The arms problem in actuality includes two levels of problems: The legality of weapons, and the jurisdiction and management of armed forces. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Hamas has obtained international acknowledgement for being the largest party in the legislature elected in a democratic and free manner, allowing its subordinate armed faction the 'Qawasameh tribe' to use legal avenues to unify itself into the government's security organizations. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Hamas once brought up unifying all armed factions into a Palestine ethnic power organization 'people's army.'  However it did not get a broad response, and also took criticism from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad Movement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> At present, Palestine has over 60,000 security organization personnel, the vast majority of which come from the Fatah camp. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Also, Fatah has some subordinate armed factions with loose organizational relations, such as the 'al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades' and the 'Fatah Hawks' and others. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Hamas, which is responsible for forming the cabinet, must come to an understanding with Abbas on how to manage these armed forces that each have their own power structures, and allocate the power of management of security in a reasonable way. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> According to the reports of local media, Abbas is interested in managing the security and information regiments, while the police and people's guard and other organizations will be subordinate to the management of the Department of the Interior of the new government. </seg>
<seg id="38"> However, all sides are still carrying out discussions on this sensitive issue, and as of now there is nothing further. </seg>

<seg id="1"> China Releases Polar Region Survey Reports for the First Time </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News February 10 from Beijing (reporter Li Jianmin).  China's State Oceanic Administration released the "2005 China Polar Region Survey Report" in recent days.  This is the first time China has released this kind of report in the over 20 years since China opened polar region scientific survey activities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The "Report" fully reflects China's polar region scientific survey activities for 2005, the safeguarding of logistics for polar region surveys, the main developments and results in polar region scientific research and other situations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to that recorded in the "Report," on January 9, 2005, at 10:15 p.m. (Beijing time), China's Polar Region Survey's Inland Ice Sheet Survey Team reached an ice dome with the highest altitude on the Antarctica shelf - Region A; on January 18 at 3:15 a.m. (Beijing time) they confirmed that the highest point on Ice Dome A was 4093 meters. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> 'On the stage of the daily intensifying competition of international polar region surveys, China relied on its will of iron and unshakable spirit to bravely open up a brand new region, and opened up an assault on the highest point on the Antarctic Ice Sheet for the first time, obtaining success in the first attempt and realizing another dream of mankind in Antarctica.' </seg>
<seg id="6"> Sun Zhihui, head of the State Oceanic Administration said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The "Report" shows that on March 24, 2005, China's 21st Antarctic Survey Team successfully completed their task and returned to Shanghai.  Their tour of research lasted 151 days, a voyage of 26,500 knots. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On November 18 of the same year, China's 22nd Antarctic Survey Team left Shanghai, going to Zhongshan Station in Antarctica to carry out scientific investigation activities, and will leave Zhongshan Station at the end of February 2006 to return to Shanghai via Australia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Because this is the first time China has released its polar region survey report, the "2005 China Polar Region Survey Report" also carried out a review and summary of Chinese polar region surveys beginning in the early 1980's. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> According to the "Report", in 1983 China formally entered the "Antarctica Treaty", became a member country of the Antarctica Treaty System, and also became a negotiating country in the Antarctica Treaty, a member of the Antarctica Science Research Committee, a member of the Antarctica Council, and other influential international organizations dealing with Antarctica. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In 1997, China became a member of the Arctic Science Committee, winning the right to decide policy and speak in international polar region affairs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The "Report" points out that in over 20 years, China's polar region surveys have "continuously developed from nothing and for the first time have real scope."  The Antarctic and Arctic Science Survey System already has "three stations and one ship," that is: Changcheng Station established in February 1985 in Antarctica, Zhongshan Station established in February 1989 in Antarctica, Huanghe Station established in July 2004 in the Arctic, and the "Xuelong" class polar survey ship that began to undertake survey missions to the Arctic in 1994. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The "Report" estimates that as of the end of 2005, China had already organized 22 Antarctic Science Surveys, two Arctic Science Surveys using the "Xuelong" as a platform, and two survey's from the Huanghe Arctic Station.  As of the present, China already has sent over 3000 people to personally go to the Antarctic or the Arctic to carry out on-sight surveys. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> "At present we are currently doing feasibility research work into building the third Antarctic survey station which would also be the first inland survey station for China." </seg>
<seg id="15"> Sun Zhihui said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "After over 20 years of hard work, China's polar region survey enterprise already has a definite position among the world's polar region surveys.  However, compared with the other main polar region surveying countries, there still exists a relatively large discrepancy.  We must push on ahead." </seg>
<seg id="17"> He said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Sun Zhihui revealed, China will publish polar region survey reports every year from now on. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News February 13 from Tokyo (reporter Qian Zheng)  Researchers of Japan's Tokai University have developed a kind of biological artificial kidney.  It not only has the same catabolic functions as a human kidney, it also has functions to maintain useful substances.  It has a small volume, is easy to transplant, and with more research there is hope it will bring good fortune to kidney disease patients. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> According to a report in previous days in the "Nikkei Business Daily", the newly developed biological artificial kidney is mainly made up of two parts.  One part is the 'artificial kidney unit' that strains out waste material and water from blood, the other part is the 'artificial urine tubes' that returns water, amino acids and other useful materials back into the blood from crude urine. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The 'artificial kidney unit' and the 'artificial urine tubes' are both made up of hollow fibers.  The inner side of the 'artificial urine tubes' are lined with the epithelia of urine tubes that have the function of dissimilating waste material. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This type of epithelia can make diseases brought about by multiple blood dialysis - such as the materials causing the formation of 'amyloid degeneration related to dialysis' dissolve into amino acids and return to the blood, while also allowing the glucose, vitamins, minerals and other things that the body needs returned to the blood. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Artificial kidneys in the past relied on the difference between permeation pressure to filter metabolized waste, and could not totally get rid of everything.  They also did not have the function of returning amino acids and other materials back into the blood. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Researchers used a goat to carry out transplant experiments with the artificial kidney.  Pig epithelia was used for the hollow fibrous inner wall of the artificial kidney used . </seg>
<seg id="8"> After two weeks, researchers confirmed that the artificial kidney was functioning. </seg>
<seg id="9"> At present they are developing a biological artificial kidney using cells from human kidneys, and will begin clinical research after they verify its safety. </seg>

<seg id="1"> China's Safe Production of Electricity Still Faces Serious Challenges </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News February 13 from Beijing (reporter An Bei).  An official of the State Electricity Supervision Committee said on February 13 that although safe production of electricity in 2005 maintained an overall stable trend, the safe production of electricity still faces serious challenges. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Shi Yubo, Chairman of the State Electricity Supervision Committee, said at the 5th (expanded) State Electricity Safe Production Committee Conference being held in Beijing that China's safe electricity production in 2005 maintained an overall stable trend.  It satisfactorily completed the task of getting through the summer peaks, realized the safe supplying of energy, actively responded to the attack of natural disasters, and basically assured the safe and stable operations of the electricity system.  Safe electricity production facility accidents and normal electricity grid accidents saw a large decrease over that of last year, and the health level of electricity facilities received enhancement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> However, he also pointed out that with the changes of the supply and demand trends of electricity as well as the successive bringing into service of newly built generator groups, safe electricity production will face new challenges. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> These challenges include the continued existence of regional, seasonal, and time interval power shortage phenomenon because electricity supply and demand trends of some areas are still tight.   The supply of electricity coal (coal used in generating electricity) still has rather large problems because there is no excellent electricity coal pricing mechanism.  At the same time, the problem of falling quality of electricity coal has not received effective controls, seriously influencing the stable operations of generator groups.  The structure of some electricity grids are weak, facilities are old and bring hidden problems to system safety.  The situation of common electricity infrastructure accidents has still not received a fundamental turn around, and the trend is still grim. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Shi Yubo said that with the deepening of reforms of the electricity system, many deep rooted contradictions will continuously be revealed.  The new problems will become how to maintain the stability of the workforce, and secure a normal production order. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In terms of tasks for safe electricity production in 2006, Shi Yubo expressed that we must further solidify the basic tasks of safe electricity production management, speed up the establishment and perfection of electricity safety emergency response management mechanisms, and increase the ability to handle unexpected incidents.  In addition, we must strengthen the coordination of the power plant grid and jointly maintain the safety of the electricity system.  We must also continue to do the tasks of supervision management and informational construction for large dam hydro electric plants, assure the safety of large dams, strengthen safety management of electricity construction, and decrease the occurrence of injuries or deaths from accidents.  Finally, we must continue to strengthen information reporting tasks and ensure the timeliness, accuracy, and free flow of electricity safety information. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> According to our understanding, by uniting with the new trends in safe electricity management the electricity supervision committee will carry out modifications and perfections of the already published "Temporary Investigation Regulations on Electricity Production Accidents" this year, while the relevant accompanying documents on large hydro electric dam safety and safety protection of the second order electrical power system will be successively issued this year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> In 2005 China's use of electricity reached 2.468 trillion kilowatt hours, a 13.5% increase over the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Facing an electricity supply and demand trend that is still tight and prominent coal power and oil transportation contradictions and other non-advantageous situations, various electricity enterprises have conscientiously taken effective measures and strengthened facility management.  Last year no extremely large facility accident occurred in the nation's electricity production. </seg>
<seg id="11"> 74 electricity grid accidents occurred, a decline of 127 from the previous year.  427 facility accidents occurred, a decline of 132 from the previous year. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News February 13 from Beijing (reporters Wang Jiangang and Hao Yalin). Temporary representative of the South African Embassy  in China Vusi B. Koloane expressed on February 13 while being interviewed by a Xinhua reporter that South Africa does not have 'organized' crime directed at Chinese citizens. </seg>
<seg id="3"> He also expressed that the South African government will do its best to "crush all forms of criminal activities." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Koloane expressed that the South African government hopes to "lower to zero" the crime rate, and hopes that the safety of the lives and property of all foreigners working in South Africa will receive the ample assurance of local law and citizens. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Since the beginning of 2006, there have already been 4 Chinese citizens that have been murdered in South Africa.  The Chinese world has expressed extensive concern over this. </seg>
<seg id="6"> China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already put forward discussion of this to South African parties, and warned Chinese citizens traveling in South Africa to further strengthen their safety and defense knowledge.  Overseas compatriots should stick together and coordinate with police to jointly crush criminal behavior. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "We express the most sincere condolences and mourning to the families of those murdered." </seg>
<seg id="8"> Koloane said, "We feel apologetic because of this.  Please allow the people of China to believe that the South African government is currently seriously investigating every case that involves China." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> According to the statement of the Chinese Embassy in South Africa, South African police have already successfully broken the case of Chinese Fujian female Chen Jianqing's murder on February 5, and one suspect is already arrested. </seg>
<seg id="10"> At present the police are pursuing another suspect. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Also according to the South African Embassy in China, a criminal wanted as a suspect in the January shooting of a Hong Kong businessman has already been arrested by South African police, and the belongings of the murdered person have already been retrieved. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> When talking about the influence that Chinese citizens being murdered is likely to produce, Koloane believes that these events "indeed" will produce some negative effects on the trade, tourism, and other areas of exchange between the two nations; but looking at the long term, the effects "shouldn't be great." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> According to the statements from Assistant Director of Tourism Manqoba Nyembezi of the South African Embassy, the Embassy sent out over 2000 visas for travel to South Africa by Chinese in the first 15 days of this year alone . </seg>
<seg id="14"> Also, according to China's official statistical data, in 2005 South Africa continued to keep China as South Africa's largest trading partner. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The volume of bilateral trade reached 7.27 billion USD, a year on year growth of 23%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> However, personnel in the tourism field believe that the Chinese citizen murders that happened in 2004 will have a clear effect on the number of Chinese going to South Africa to travel. </seg>
<seg id="17"> According to the statistics of the South African Tourism Bureau, the first half of 2005 saw 20,331 Chinese tourists travel to South Africa, a drop of 14.9% with that of the year before. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> At present there are around 200,000 Chinese that live in South Africa, spread throughout South Africa's cities, towns, and villages. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Analysts believe that the disparity between rich and poor in South Africa is great, the level of unemployment high, guns are everywhere, and there is no deterrence from a death penalty; thus the crime rate is high. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Because many Chinese do not understand English but keep cash on their persons and at home, they more easily become targets for criminals looking for money. </seg>

<seg id="2"> Xinhua News February 14 from Beijing (reporter Meng Nuo).  Department Head Zheng Baigang of the Police Affairs Censorship Department of the Ministry of Public Safety (MPS) pointed out when responding to the questions of foreign reporters at a MPS news conference that the so called situation of "using unsuitable methods to make suspects admit crimes" in China is definitely not permitted. </seg>

<seg id="2"> Xinhua News February 15 from Beijing (reporter Li Jiangtao)  After several days of hurried decorations, the funeral hall that Beijing University set up to remember school Academician Wang Xuan at Centennial Anniversary Lecture Hall formally opened at 9:00 a.m. on February 15. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> At a little past eight in the morning, the opening of the funeral hall had still not occurred, yet there were already several tens of people queued outside. </seg>
<seg id="4"> This reporter saw inside the great memorial hall of Beijing University's Centennial Anniversary Lecture Hall that hanging on the walls of the great hall was a black banner: "Solemnly mourn Academician Wang Xuan." </seg>
<seg id="5"> Below the banner was a huge picture of Wang Xuan (over 10 square meters big).  He is wearing glasses, smiling slightly, and his temperament is of learned elegance. </seg>
<seg id="6"> On both sides of the portrait were several dragon cypress trees and several tens of flower wreaths lined up on each side. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Among these, the funeral couplet of one of the flower wreaths said:  "This foundational skill that glorified China began in the Qin Dynasty and matured in the Tang dynasty / he sent off lead writing implements and welcomed in electronics as a modern day Bi Sheng to draw a blueprint for his invention." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> There was soft funeral music in the hall and the atmosphere was solemn and heavy. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Among those mourning Academician Wang Xuan were Beijing University leaders, teachers and students.  There were friends, colleagues, students, neighbors, and even people he did not know that had specially come. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Some had fresh flowers in their hands, some held flower baskets, and every person had a small white flower pinned to his or her chest.  They slowly made their way to before the picture of Academician Wang Xuan and bowed to show their respect. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Many people could not help but to shed warm tears. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Zhang Wenbin, who once was the bureau head of the State Cultural Bureau, is an old Beijing University alumni.  He told this reporter that over ten years ago when he was still working in Henan Province, he once invited Professor Wang Xuan to give a report on science and technology innovation to cadres of the provincial committee. </seg>
<seg id="13"> "Academician Wang Xuan was a model for both pursuing studies and personal conduct.  He made important contributions to the nation and society and the people will never forget him." </seg>

<seg id="15"> A few days ago he just got out of the hospital.  Today he insisted on coming here to say goodbye to his old friend. </seg>
<seg id="16"> When Mr. Jin left a message in the message book, he could not control his grief, and had to wipe away the tears flowing from his eyes several times. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> He told reporters, the daily life of Professor Wang Xuan was extremely thrifty and simple, "When he lived in the Tongfuyuan Community, he already was a professor, and already had very high accomplishments, yet still only lived in a very small bungalow for many years. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Later he moved to the Chengzeyuan Community, and lived in a 78 square meter place for over 10 years. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Beijing University gave him a 140 plus square meter apartment in Langqiying Academician Building, but he didn't want it.  He also refused a high-rise apartment that Fangzheng Mansions offered him." </seg>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News February 15 from Beijing (reporters Zhou Wei and Li Fei).  At present many websites all rely on reproduced news reports from a large volume of newspapers and magazines and other media to increase their hit rates, however many have not obtained authorization, and do not pay compensation.  Department Head Wang Ziqiang of the National Copyright Administration's Department of Copyrighting stated at a news conference held at the News Office of the State Council that the information network broadcasting rights protection articles which the State Council will introduce will supply a resolution concerning the problem of payment for works reproduced on the internet,. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Wang Ziqiang said that according to the regulations of the laws currently in effect, works already published in newspapers and periodicals can be used by newspapers and periodicals without the agreement of the author as long as the author doesn't make a declaration of "cannot be used."  However, newspapers and periodicals must pay compensation for works republished.  The National Copyright Administration has set the standards for compensation for reproduced works of newspapers and periodicals specifically according to what the law stipulates. </seg>
<seg id="4"> However, according to the regulations of laws currently in effect, newspaper and periodical agencies enjoy the rights of this statutory license, but at present the Internet does not enjoy these rights. </seg>
<seg id="5"> According to relevant judicial interpretation by the supreme people's court, statutory license for reproduction of newspaper and periodical works can be suitably used for the Internet.  Short articles published on newspapers, periodicals, and the Internet can be used by internet sites without obtaining approval while also paying compensation as long as the author does not declare works "cannot be used." </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News February 16 from Changchun (reporter Zhou Liquan).  After an extremely large fire occurred in Liaoyuan City's Central Hospital in Jilin Province, the accident investigation group confirmed 11 responsible.  Among those responsible, Zhang Diankun, head of a team of electricians, and three others will be prosecuted as suspects in a major accident due to negligence. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> On December 15, 2005, a fire occurred in Liaoyuan City's largest hospital - Central Hospital, causing 39 deaths. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="6"> According to investigations, the accident happened at around 4:30 p.m. that day when Liaoyuan City's Central Hospital suddenly lost electricity.  According to the circuitry design of the hospital, if the electricity goes out, the transformer breaker should automatically switch to the auxiliary breaker and continue to maintain a normal supply of electricity to the hospital.  However, at that time the electricity breaker did not automatically switch.  Zhang Diankun, head of a team of electricians, forced a power transmission without investigating the reason the electricity stopped, leading to the start of the fire. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Also, the underground electrical cable lines giving off smoke had over ten cables that were disorderly and unsystematically tangled together.  These electrical cables should have been laid out and placed extremely orderly, and fire protection layers should have been installed. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="1"> (Winter Olympics - Stimulants) News Analysis: Pyleva Incident Likely to End Inconclusive </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News February 17 from Turin.  News Analysis: Pyleva incident likely to end inconclusive </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Xinhua News reporter Gao Peng and Ding Ying </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Although Italy repeatedly issued orders saying that all athletes discovered using stimulants during the Turin Olympics would likely face "the specter of jail;" however, looking at various circumstances it seems that the main character in the first stimulant scandal of this Winter Olympics, Russian biathlon athlete Olga Pyleva, will not likely face jail-time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The Turin Olympic Committee revealed the first stimulant scandal of the games on February 16.  It was discovered that Olga Pyleva used the prohibited stimulant Carphedon. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The next day, the International Olympic Committee announced that Pyleva had already been expelled from the Winter Olympics, and the gold medal she won in the women's biathlon 15 km individual race at this Winter Olympics had already been stripped from her. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The International Biathlon Union passed a punitive decision to ban Pyleva from competition for two years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> It has always been that the International Olympic Committee stipulated that athletes discovered using stimulants at the Olympic Games would have their scores cancelled and have their qualifications for taking part in events taken away, but they would not receive the punishment of the law. </seg>
<seg id="9"> However, according to Italian law, athletes carrying and using stimulants is considered criminal behavior and judicial authorities have the right to directly arrest and investigate the athlete using stimulates.  Those defying the law face anywhere from three months to three years in prison. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Last December, the International Olympic Committee and the Italian Government concluded "negotiations" that had lasted as long as a year, finally reaching an agreement that both sides would deal with athletes using stimulants according to Italian Law at this Winter Olympics. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> After the tireless efforts of the International Olympic Committee, Italy gave a concession four days before the opening ceremony for the Winter Olympics, promising that during the Winter Olympics police would not enter the Olympic village and search the residences of athletes.  However, athletes that showed positive for drugs would still be investigated by Italian authorities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Reports state that Mario Pescante, the official supervising the Turin Olympics for the Italian government, has already handed over the Pyleva stimulant incident to Turin investigating authorities. </seg>
<seg id="13"> However, the International Olympic Committee and Pescante have not confirmed this as of present. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Russian team doctor for the biathlon team Andrey Dmytriev revealed on February 17 that Pyleva had already left Turin and returned to Russia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Chinese Sports Official Shi Liancheng, who worked for many years at the world anti-stimulant organization, believes that as soon as Pyleva returns to Russia, this incident's ending will likely be "inconclusive." </seg>
<seg id="16"> Shi Liancheng said that the International Olympic Committee and the Italian government have never "thoroughly resolved" the anti-stimulant problems at the Winter Olympics, and although the Italian investigating authorities have indeed come into play, the results are hard to predict. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Looking at the punishments in judgment of cases of domestic athletes using stimulants in Italy, the most serious punishments that offenders have received is no more than "two years of suspended imprisonment." </seg>
<seg id="18"> Therefore, senior reporter Pieri of Italy's Ansa News expressed that the likelihood of Pyleva going to prison is "extremely small," and at most a fine will be given. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Pieri expressed that although Italian courts can carry out sentencing without the accused present, Italian police are not likely to go abroad to bring Pyleva back for punishment. </seg>
<seg id="20"> If Pyleva refuses to accept the judgment, then Italy will have no way to get her. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> A chicken farm in the capital of Cameroon, Yaounde, has already had over 800 chickens die mysteriously within the last week. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Cameroon has already decided to temporarily stop at once all fowl and pork imports from Nigeria, where a bird flu epidemic has broken out.  Cameroon also temporarily stopped all trade of fowl and related products in all markets along the border of the two nations. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The Cameroonian government has in a short period of time set up an epidemic monitoring network that covers the entire border.  That nation's Pasteur Center and the national veterinary labratory already are in a state of emergency awaiting orders to prepare for labratory tests for the H5N1 virus that could begin at any time. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="13"> Results of the initial laboratory tests of Denmark's national veterinary management administration show that the 30 dead swans recently discovered within the borders of Denmark did not have the bird flu virus. </seg>
<seg id="14"> However the ministry of agriculture expressed that Demark still cannot be worry-free. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Romania in Eastern Europe has already seen nine bird flu epidemic outbreaks this year.  Experts of the WHO said on February 17 in Bucharest that virtually all areas of the delta region of the Danube River have bird flu, and this situation must be dealt with seriously.  Romania is expected to be threatened by the bird flu for the next 3 to 5 years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> In Asia's Bangladesh, the government has taken all needed steps to prevent bird flu. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The government's domestic animal service ministry provided books concerning how to prevent bird flu to relevant officials, and also organized training for domestic fowl raisers. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News February 18 from Beijing.  According to information revealed by Zhejiang's Blood Center, China's first Shared Blood Information Data Management Control Network System has recently been formally established and put into use at that center. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> A relevant authority of the Zhejiang Province Blood Center said that this means that any citizen can participate in no-compensation blood donation in any county (city, district) blood collection and supply clinic now and in the future.  Each donor will have a unique coded record; and when they donate blood again, as long as their relevant coded record is typed in, their personal information, blood type, blood donation record, last time of blood donation, and if they can participate in blood donation this time or not as well as other information will immediately be displayed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> This authority further explained that when inputting the relevant record, if the system displays that the interval period since the last no-compensation blood donation of that donor is not up yet, then it will indicate that that person does not meet requirements for blood donation at that time. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In this way not only is the health of blood donors protected, but the system will also more effectively protect the health and safety of those who need blood. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Besides this, when blood supplies are tight, blood donors and their family members will have preference for blood use.  One only needs to input the valid identification of blood donors and the blood donor's information will immediately be displayed, it's quite convenient. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Let's again direct our attention to the Iran nuclear issue. </seg>
<seg id="2"> The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed on the 6th that the Iranian government has written a letter to the IAEA requesting for the removal of all the equipment monitoring Iran's nuclear facilities by the middle of this month. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Due to the IAEA decision to report the Iran nuclear issue to the UN Security Council, Iran has announced the termination of all its support and cooperation measures on the nuclear issue and will no longer allow the IAEA to conduct snap inspection of its nuclear facilities. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In response to the current tensions concerning the Iran nuclear issue, Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov said in Athens, Greece, that the cooperation between Russia and Iran still exists. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This will become the motivation for the resolution to the Iran nuclear issue. </seg>
<seg id="6"> A Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson said that day that Russia's proposal to Iran for establishing a joint uranium enrichment enterprise in Russia still stands. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The two sides may conduct negotiations on this issue next week. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On the same day, Lugar, chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said at the UN headquarters in New York that the US does not endorse Israeli attacks on Iran's nuclear facilities. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Some recent news report said that Israeli defense experts said that the Israeli Air Force may deal serious blows to Iran's nuclear facilities if necessary. </seg>
<seg id="10"> According to Xinhua News Agency, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Kislyak said on the 7th that Russia is willing to cooperate with Iran on the nuclear issue so as to help Iran obtain the legal right to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Kislyak said that Russia's proposal for a joint uranium enrichment enterprise with Iran is still valid now. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Russia hopes to have negotiations with Iran on this issue in the near future. </seg>
<seg id="13"> At the end of December last year, Russia submitted a proposal to Iran regarding the establishment of a joint uranium enrichment enterprise by the two countries in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Both the EU and the US indicated that they can accept this plan for a compromise. </seg>
<seg id="15"> However, Iran hopes that Russia can continue to revise the original plan. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Kong Quan said on the 7th that though the IAEA reported the Iran nuclear issue to the UN Security Council, it did not hand over the agency's responsibility for handling the Iran nuclear issue to the Security Council. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Therefore, all parties still need to break the deadlock on the Iran nuclear issue within the IAEA framework. </seg>
<seg id="18"> According to the IAEA resolution, IAEA Director General ElBaradei will submit a report on the Iran nuclear issue to the Security Council in March. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The Security Council will make a final decision after evaluating this report. </seg>
<seg id="20"> We think this resolution is asking Iran to fulfill the relevant Security Council resolution and its commitments without submitting or referring the issue to the Security Council. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Recently, China has been seeking a peaceful resolution to the Iran nuclear issue through diplomatic channels. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Kong Quan said that on February 1, Zhang Yan, director-general of Arms Control and Disarmament Department of China's Foreign Ministry, and Larijani, secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council and chief nuclear negotiator, held talks on the Iran nuclear issue in Tehran. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The Chinese side hopes that Iran should pay attention to the key issue of the international community and create conditions for peaceful resolution to the Iran nuclear issue. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Solving the Iran nuclear issue within the IAEA framework not only conforms to the interests of the Chinese side but also, as we believe firmly, conforms to the interests of all parties concerned. </seg>
<seg id="25"> For that purpose, we also call upon all relevant parties in the international community again not to abandon diplomatic efforts for this issue. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Hamas, which is currently forming a new Palestinian autonomous government, officially announced that except for the candidate for prime minister, the name list of the new government's cabinet has been basically finalized. </seg>
<seg id="2"> This led outsiders to have a variety of speculations on the candidate for prime minister. </seg>
<seg id="3"> A senior Hamas official disclosed to the Associated Press on the 8th that Hamas is preparing to nominate al-Khudairi, board chairman ((merchant)) of the Islamic University in Gaza, as prime minister of the new autonomous government, but this nomination has not been officially submitted to Abbas. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Backed by Hamas, 50-year-old al-Khudairi participated in the election of the Palestinian Legislative Council as an independent candidate last month. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Al-Khudairi never mentioned violence or anything against Israel in his public speech. </seg>
<seg id="6"> However, he said that Palestine needs internal reforms. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Currently, a senior Hamas delegation is visiting Cairo and discussing with Egypt on the issue of Hamas forming a new Palestinian government. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Khalid Mashal, one of the delegates, told the news media on the 8th that in spite of the pressure that has kept coming from the international community and some Arab countries, the Palestinian government formed by the leadership of Hamas will not recognize Israel. </seg>
<seg id="9"> At the same time, Mashal also warned Abbas in his speech not to willfully change the structure of the Palestinian leadership without prior consultation with Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Analysts consider this a response to Abbas's plan to appoint Interior Minister Yusuf as deputy commander of the security forces. </seg>
<seg id="11"> However, regarding the issue of forming a new Palestinian autonomous government, Mashal refused to confirm the news that Hamas is preparing to nominate al-Khudairi, board chairman ((merchant)) of the Islamic University in Gaza, to serve as prime minister of the government. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Mashal said that the candidate for prime minister has not been finalized. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Prior to Mashal's reiteration of refusing to recognize Israel, Marzouk, another Hamas political leader, said in an interview with Egyptian TV that Hamas will absolutely not recognize the legitimate status of Israel, but the new government will continue to keep contact with Israel in various areas, because recognizing Israel or not is a totally different thing from whether to have contact with it. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Apart from the fresh or old hatred of the three Hamas prime minister candidates against Israel, the issue of the territory has also been a tough question concerning Palestinian-Israeli relations. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Israeli Acting Prime Minister Olmert said in an interview with Israel TV Channel 2 on the 7th that Israel must separate from Palestine by setting permanent borders. </seg>
<seg id="16"> This means that Israel will have to withdraw from part of its territories in the West Bank. </seg>
<seg id="17"> However, Olmert stressed that Israel will continue to control major Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Jordan Valley area and maintain the integrity of Jerusalem. </seg>

<seg id="4"> At 4:30 p.m. on the 7th, Prime Minister Rasmussen and the foreign minister held a press conference at Denmark's Prime Minister's Residence. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Rasmussen said. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The violent incidents occurring at the embassies of several European countries are no longer something between Muslim countries and Denmark. </seg>
<seg id="7"> It is very important for the Danish government and Danish people to get the broad support of the international community to resolve this tough issue. </seg>
<seg id="8"> We are allied with France. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Some organizations of other European countries and the United States in Muslim countries are cooperating closely. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Just a few minutes ago, US President Bush made a phone call here. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In the phone call, he expressed support for Denmark, standing by Denmark. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Rasmussen said, we also think that we should resolve this issue through dialogue and tolerance, not through violence. </seg>
<seg id="13"> We stress freedom and democracy, and respect the precious value of religious belief. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Today I appeal to people in all Muslim countries to work together to suppress violence and prevent it from spreading. </seg>
<seg id="15"> We need to resolve the issue through dialogue, not through violence. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Today we are facing growing international developments of the incident. </seg>
<seg id="17"> We saw the Danish national flag burnt and the embassy damaged. </seg>
<seg id="18"> We saw Danish people being considered intolerant people and the enemy of Islam. </seg>
<seg id="19"> This is wrong. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Extremists and radicals are taking advantage of the incident of cultural conflict to escalate the situation. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Rasmussen stressed, we, Denmark and Danish people, are not the enemy of Islam and other religions. </seg>
<seg id="22"> For generations, Danish people have been pursuing human rights, democracy, and freedom beyond politics. </seg>

<seg id="29"> NTD correspondents Li Luo and Dan Ni reporting from Copenhagen, Denmark. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Angry with the publication of the cartoons of Muhammad, Iranian extremists attacked the Danish embassy in Tehran again on Tuesday, throwing gas bombs. </seg>
<seg id="31"> In the meantime, a state-owned Iranian newspaper, in retaliation, held a contest on cartoons about the Nazi Holocaust. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The United States denounced the move as taking the opportunity to reinforce Iranian President Ahmadinejad's persistent outrageous anti-Israeli practices. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Some twenty to thirty protesters climbed over the wall and entered the Danish embassy compound in Iran. </seg>
<seg id="34"> In addition, more than three hundred people threw rocks and gas bombs at the building from outside. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The day before, student members of Iran's hard-line militia led hundreds of demonstrators in attacking the Danish and Austrian embassies in Tehran. </seg>
<seg id="36"> The controversial cartoons were first published by the Jutland Post in Denmark in September of last year. </seg>
<seg id="37"> They were successively reprinted in other European countries and three Arab newspapers. </seg>
<seg id="38"> In retaliation, Hamshahri, Iran's best-selling newspaper, recently announced that it would hold a contest on cartoons depicting the slaughter of Jews by the Nazi Germany. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The move was strongly denounced by the United States and other countries. </seg>
<seg id="40"> US State Department spokesman McCormack said that he thinks the move by the best-selling Iranian newspaper Hamshahri was to reinforce Iranian President Ahmadinejad's vicious anti-Israeli remarks. </seg>
<seg id="41"> McCormack reiterated the US support of freedom of speech in all parts of the world, including Iran. </seg>
<seg id="42"> But he thinks Hamshahri's cartoon contest was totally a different thing from the publication of the cartoons of Muhammad by the Danish media. </seg>
<seg id="43"> McCormack said, I don't think that someone will mention Iran's freedom of the press in connection with the freedom of the press in western Europe and the United States. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Ahmadinejad once called the Holocaust a myth and urged to wipe Israel off the map, setting off widespread criticism by the United States and other countries. </seg>
<seg id="45"> McCormack thinks that Hamshahri is funded by the conservative Tehran municipal government. </seg>
<seg id="46"> It was no coincidence that it should hold this cartoon contest. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Since Attorney Gao Zhicheng initiated a coordinated 24-hour hunger strike campaign in ten cities across the country on February 14, protesting CPC persecution, recently another 170 Shanghai petitioners collectively signed on, expressing their willingness to participate in this human rights hunger strike. </seg>
<seg id="2"> In addition, they said they will continue to publicize the signatures and number of people in the second group of participants. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Next, let's take a look at an interview report by this station. </seg>
<seg id="4"> According to our understanding, under the government's intentional manipulation, real estate prices in Shanghai have become among the highest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Many government units think of all kinds of ways to forcibly tear down citizens' residences in high-priced neighborhoods without giving reasonable compensation. </seg>
<seg id="6"> These ordinary people who have suffered compulsory eviction, thereby losing their homes, have suddenly lost their sources of income. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Children are unable to pay tuition, and cannot attend school. </seg>
<seg id="8"> For many years, most people who appealed to higher authorities have been sent to reform-through-labor camps for long periods of time. </seg>
<seg id="9"> According to statistical data, Shanghai is the region of China with the largest number of people appealing to higher authorities. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Han Zhongming used to own a storefront, yet it was forcibly torn down.  His private residence was also sold by others for profit. </seg>
<seg id="11"> He was put under house arrest by authorities and was even detained because he appealed to higher authorities. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Having jumped from a building and slit his wrists, among other forms of protest, he was only recently released. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Chen Enjuan's storefront was also forcibly torn down by the government. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The government hired goons to drag her family of three out of their home and used bulldozers to raze the house together with the furniture. </seg>
<seg id="15"> She was sent to a reform-through-labor camp for nearly two years because she appealed to higher authorities. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Speaking about this hunger strike in support of the protest, Chen Enjuan said that besides it was for protesting against government iniquity, </seg>
<seg id="17"> Attorney Gao has also given us a lot of help and very unselfishly helped us. </seg>
<seg id="18"> We are safeguarding our rights because we want democracy, ah, because we are thinking of the next generation. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Our older generation has suffered enough.  We also need to make sure that the next generation will not suffer persecution.  That is why we want to participate in that human rights campaign.  We cannot give up. </seg>
<seg id="20"> According to the Center on Housing Rights and Evictions, a Geneva-based human rights organization, China has been listed among countries with the most serious housing rights violations in the world. </seg>

<seg id="25"> Legislator Leung Kwok-hung, who supports Attorney Gao Zhicheng's hunger strike campaign, said that CPC authorities recently have made reckless arrests of human rights activists, which is a dangerous signal showing that this government is absolutely not based on popular will. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The same day happened to be the day for Legislator Attorney Ho Chun-yan, who is preparing to establish a human rights observation team, to have his weekly one-day fast. </seg>
<seg id="27"> He said that this week on this day, he would introduce to outsiders how a human rights attorney in China works. </seg>
<seg id="28"> At the same time, he is sure that this kind of human rights campaign will certainly continue. </seg>
<seg id="29"> On February 13, Epoch Times employees and Falun Gong practitioners in greater Calgary, Canada, held a joint press conference in front of the Chinese consulate to voice their support for the human rights hunger strike relay at home and abroad initiated by Attorney Gao Zhicheng.  In addition, they also protested against the atrocities committed by CPC overseas special agents against Falun Gong practitioner Li Yuan in the United States, calling on the Canadian government as well as all righteous individuals at home and abroad to pay attention to and voice their support for China's human rights movement. </seg>

<seg id="38"> Professor Yang Wei-che from the math department of National Taiwan University said: </seg>
<seg id="39"> "This is extremely important. </seg>
<seg id="40"> It will absolutely become a force. </seg>
<seg id="41"> The evil hand and its vicious tyranny will find it very hard to subdue." </seg>
<seg id="42"> More than 40 people from Delaware, Philadelphia, southern New Jersey, and New York who care about China's democracy and freedom attended a press conference on the global human rights hunger strike relay held in front of the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia, condemning CPC special agents' armed beating of Dr. Li Yuan, technical supervisor of the Epoch Times, in broad daylight, and voiced their support for the righteous act of Attorney Gao Zhicheng in China. </seg>

<seg id="2"> Due to concerns that increasing Maoist rebellions over the past few months may spill across the border, three new battalions have been added to the BSF with the responsibility of guarding the 200-kilometer-long Indian-Nepalese border in the district of Darjeeling. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Nepal has the Himalayas in the north. </seg>
<seg id="4"> It borders India on the other three sides with a border that extends for 1,477 kilometers. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Maoist rebels often sneak into Indian border villages and acquire weapons from local gangs and drug dealers. </seg>

<seg id="17"> This is the fourth consecutive quarter that Japan saw economic growth.  Furthermore, from the first quarter to the third quarter of 2005, it was the largest rate of growth.  It was mainly helped by the stability of personal expenditures, capital expenditures, and exports. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In addition, in April Japan's central bank will end the exceptionally lax currency policy of the past five years, which also backed financial market expectations of economic health. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Following slight improvements in unemployment and wages, consumer expenditures from October to December rose 0.8%. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Immediately following the IAEA decision to submit the Iran nuclear issue to the UN Security Council for resolution, Iran reiterated that there is no room for it to have any negotiation with the US, one of the sponsors. </seg>
<seg id="2"> Er, an Iranian government spokesperson said on Monday that the policy toward the US has so far been not to discuss and negotiate over the relations with the other party. </seg>
<seg id="3"> He said that the West made a huge mistake to submit the nuclear issue to the Security Council, which shows the Western interference in the development of Iran. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Iran said on Sunday that it will terminate its cooperation with the IAEA.  In addition, it will resume uranium enrichment and ban snap inspection of its nuclear facilities. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Well, Iran's attitude is now quite firm on this issue, while the US takes an even firmer attitude. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Er, US Defense Secretary Rumsfeld has frequently reiterated that the use of force will not be ruled out on this issue. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Well, now rumors said that the US military is indeed carrying out such a plan. </seg>
<seg id="8"> They are researching and developing a super-sized mother of all bombs. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Er, once the Defense Department issues the order, they will use this super-sized bomb to blow up Iran. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Then, how big a bomb is this mother of all bombs? </seg>
<seg id="11"> Its weight alone is said to be more than thirty thousand pounds, which is equivalent to that of a two-story bus.  Er, in addition, it is also very large in size. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Well, the main purpose of developing such a super bomb is to blow up some underground facilities in Iran. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Since it has an extremely powerful penetration, it can penetrate the concrete as well as steel plate, probably causing a large pit of about 60 feet long and half a mile in size.  Er, it will destroy many underground construction and facilities. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Well, it now seems that the United States has really started to sharpen its spear or make bombs at the last minute in this respect. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Rumsfeld said that no method will be ruled out on this issue, the resolution to the Iran nuclear issue.  The method of force has already been put on the agenda. </seg>
<seg id="16"> In addition, the Iran nuclear issue is continuing to escalate.  Well, er, relevant Iranian officials in China said in an interview with this station that actually Iran still insists on cooperating with the international community through peaceful negotiations, er, in hopes of relieving the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="17"> However, they also said that Iran will adjust the content of its nuclear project cooperation with Russia. </seg>
<seg id="18"> With regard to the upcoming second round of talks on the uranium enrichment cooperation project between Iran and Russia on February 16, the Iranian side said that the talks will be carried out as scheduled, but it stressed that the content of talks will be adjusted based on the current developments of the situation. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Earlier Russia always expressed its support for Iran's peaceful use of nuclear energy and said it would not refer the Iran nuclear issue to the Security Council. </seg>
<seg id="20"> However, now we see they have agreed to refer the Iran nuclear issue to the UN Security Council. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Under this new situation now, we may make some changes regarding our policy agreed upon with Russia earlier. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Yet, before the UN Security Council makes its final decision in March on whether to adopt economic and political sanctions, Iran maintains that it will continue to negotiate with relevant international institutions.  At the same time it is willing to cooperate with the international community to relieve the current crisis. </seg>
<seg id="23"> We emphasized that Iran will not relinquish its right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy in order to attain its own economic and national development. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Iran has not violated any relevant international law, and we hope the United States can also understand that. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The Iran nuclear issue is completely different from the issues of Afghanistan and Iraq. </seg>
<seg id="26"> I think the US itself is well aware of this point. </seg>
<seg id="27"> With regard to the so-called military attacks, we have not seen that the US has declared any explicit position. </seg>
<seg id="28"> We don't want to see the crisis further escalate. </seg>
<seg id="29"> We also emphasize on using the method of peaceful negotiations, but we will not yield to pressure. </seg>
<seg id="30"> In addition ((agebi)) also expressed hope that China will continue to cooperate with Iran on the basis of its original position. </seg>

<seg id="29"> This comprehensive report has been brought to you by Phoenix Satellite TV. </seg>
<seg id="30"> As the blizzard swept across the US northeast region, New York City is naturally one of the cities affected. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Let's now connect with Luo Xiaoying, our New York-based correspondent, to find out about the local situation. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Hello, Xiaoying. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Hello, Xiaonan. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="35"> With such a heavy snowfall here, how exactly is everything going? </seg>
<seg id="36"> I heard that some places did not even have power supply. </seg>
<seg id="37"> What other places are affected? </seg>
<seg id="38"> Yes, that's right. </seg>
<seg id="39"> In fact, this blizzard covered quite an extensive area, ah. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Well, I am happy to tell you that we have now finally seen that the blizzard has stopped. </seg>
<seg id="41"> In spite of the fierce onset of the blizzard, oh, no serious casualties have been reported. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Within its scope, several states in the eastern US were affected.  For instance, Maryland recorded 21 inches of snow, Pennsylvania, 19 inches, and the areas in New York and New Jersey, over 24 inches. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Flurries of snow can be seen from Virginia to Maine, or even Tennessee. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Well, er, as you mentioned just now, um, many places in the Washington area and Baltimore indeed experienced power shortage. </seg>
<seg id="45"> The %pw total number of households cut from power is probably more than one hundred thousand. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Well, New York City is fine.  The outage, er, power supply in the Manhattan area of New York City is very normal.  Only some places in the Long Island area experienced power outage. </seg>
<seg id="47"> The state of Rhode Island declared a state of emergency. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Well, roads are open only to emergency vehicles such as snow plowers and ambulances. </seg>
<seg id="49"> With regard to traffic and transportation, oh, earlier the three major airports in the, um, New York area were all closed. </seg>
<seg id="50"> However, er, toward evening, we found, for instance, the Newark airport in New Jersey and LaGuardia airport in New York have started to show some signs of resuming airport operations. </seg>
<seg id="51"> So, some people estimated that these airports may be opened in a few hours. </seg>
<seg id="52"> For example, Delta Airlines, eh, Delta Airlines, it announced that flights at places like Washington, Philadelphia, Boston, Baltimore, and Connecticut were all cancelled till Monday, oh. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Now the Reagan airport in the capital of Washington is currently open. </seg>

<seg id="58"> Well, for New York people, most of their usual Sunday activities were also cancelled.  Oh, few people went outdoors, that is, everyone stayed at home. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Uh-huh. </seg>
<seg id="60"> What gives people headaches is how they are supposed to go to work on Monday. </seg>
<seg id="61"> In addition, the clear snow, the accumulated snow may cause some flooding. </seg>
<seg id="62"> So, the governments in these affected areas in the US are studying how to deal with the rushing crowds of commuters and cars on their way to work on Monday. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Let's look at a few Japan-related news items. </seg>
<seg id="2"> Er, Koizumi has always wanted to upgrade Japan's Defense Agency to a ministry, so as to increase Japan's military strength. </seg>
<seg id="3"> However, along the way, this process has aroused a lot of controversy and undergone many twists and turns. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Recently, some project bid-rigging scandals broke out in the Defense Facilities Administration Agency under Japan's Defense Agency, causing some current and former officials to be arrested by authorities. </seg>
<seg id="5"> As a result, quite a few people advised Koizumi to be careful about upgrading the agency to a ministry. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Well, recently Koizumi said that he would shelve this plan and would not submit it to the Diet for review for the time being. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Well, he also hopes the two governing parties can carefully discuss this issue and continue, er, consultations. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On another note, if you go to Japan, there is now a new regulation. </seg>
<seg id="9"> That is, Japan plans, stipulates that most tourists and travelers to Japan must have their fingerprints scanned and photographs taken. </seg>
<seg id="10"> This is a way of preventing some dangerous people from entering Japanese territory, and in addition, of guarding against illegal immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Er, so, going to Japan should now be even more difficult. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Well, of course, recently there has also been a piece of good news in Japan. </seg>
<seg id="13"> That is, Princess Kiko, wife of Japan's Prince Akishinomiya, is pregnant. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The event makes many Japanese hopeful that she can give birth to a boy to succeed the throne. </seg>
<seg id="15"> However, she also brought some disturbance to the otherwise quite peaceful Imperial Household. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Er, in fact Kiko is now surely quite old for a pregnant woman.  Moreover, people have always thought she was satisfied with a four-member family. </seg>
<seg id="17"> To be pregnant again at such an age, many people cannot help speculating that er, this may be a fight for the throne between brothers of the Imperial Household. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Of course, this conspiracy theory has been a fascinating topic for many people. </seg>
<seg id="19"> It is said that this matter may be traced back to several years ago. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Er, it is like this.  When the wife of Crown Prince Naruhito suffered from depression in 2002, the Imperial Household placed little hope on them and turned to put pressure on Prince Fumihito. </seg>
<seg id="21"> At that time, Fumihito did not respond much to this. </seg>
<seg id="22"> But by 2004, the conflict had become somewhat intense, because Naruhito, eager to protect his wife, criticized the Imperial Household in public. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Well, it is said that the Imperial Household at that time was furious and asked Prince Fumihito, who is of the same generation, to come out and accuse his elder brother of showing no respect to the Imperial Household while spoiling his own wife. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The two brothers have not been on good terms since. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Well, now if a boy is born to Prince Fumihito, then they, as core members, will become a pillar of the Imperial Household. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Meanwhile, the Eastern Palace, that is, the elder prince, would surely decline as a result. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Er, so, quite a number of people think that if this is the case, it will have a great impact on the Imperial Household and Japanese society. </seg>

<seg id="1"> On Monday UN Secretary General Annan went to the White House to meet with US President Bush. </seg>
<seg id="2"> With regard to Iran's announcement of its postponement of nuclear talks with Russia, Annan urged Iran to stop nuclear activities as soon as possible and resolve the issue through negotiations instead of confrontation. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In addition, some sources said that the US Defense Department has actually already started planning for an intensive bombing on Iran as a last resort should diplomatic efforts fail. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Originally, outsiders think that Bush and Annan would discuss the possibility of the UN Security Council sanctions against Iran, but the two did not publicize any discussion in this regard after their meeting. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Both Bush and Annan reiterated their hope that the Iran nuclear issue should be resolved through negotiations. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Annan expressed his concern that Iran started uranium enrichment and decided to postpone nuclear negotiations with Russia. </seg>
<seg id="7"> On the same day, US media reports said that military tactic experts from the Pentagon have already started planning for an intensive military action so that the US will prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons by military means should diplomatic efforts fail. </seg>
<seg id="8"> According to the reports, the commander of the US Central Command is making decisions on the targets of attacks. </seg>
<seg id="9"> There may be a submarine-launched ballistic missile strike or air strikes by B-2 bombers. </seg>
<seg id="10"> On Monday, Annan called upon all parties involved not to take any action that may escalate the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Some military experts analyzed that Iran may acquire the ability to produce nuclear weapons within two years. </seg>
<seg id="12"> And there are more than two years left from Bush's second term. </seg>
<seg id="13"> He will try to resolve the Iran nuclear issue during his term whether by peaceful or military means. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Mo Naiqian reporting from Washington for Phoenix Satellite TV. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Iranian President Ahmadinejad said on the 13th that superpowers that threaten other countries with their own weapons will soon disappear. </seg>
<seg id="16"> At the 27th anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution, Ahmadinejad met with diplomatic envoys of various countries in Tehran. </seg>
<seg id="17"> He said that arms race and competition for hegemony among various countries in the world will achieve nothing. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The greed of super powers can never be satisfied.  They even threaten other countries with their weapons. </seg>
<seg id="19"> However, he said that these super powers that rely on their weapons to bully other countries will soon disappear. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The day when mankind enjoys eternal peace and stability will soon come. </seg>
<seg id="21"> So, we can see this is not merely a battle of words now.  In fact, the mounting tensions between Iran and the West are indeed becoming more and more intense. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Well, since Iran and the US are making no concession to each other in their positions, recently there have also been some format changes.  That is, Iran officially announced the day before yesterday that they will resume their uranium enrichment programs. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In fact, some Western diplomats speculated that they might have actually resumed some procedures for uranium enrichment prior to this. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In addition, Iran also announced that it would postpone its talks with Russia indefinitely.  That is, the talks on Russia refining uranium for Iran. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Well, of course, the indefinite postponement of the talks was also decided based on this new situation. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Well, recently, since the US continues to threaten Iran with attacks, the Oxford Research Institute, a UK think tank, issued this report. </seg>
<seg id="27"> If the US really wants to use force, then half of the people will be dead because of that.  In addition, it will of course trigger, um, may keep this year's wave of violence in the Middle East going on. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Besides, some terrorist attacks will also escalate. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Of course, oil prices will also soar, which is also one of the series of Domino effects. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Furthermore, this report said that if the US fails to subdue Iran, Iran will surely speed up its determination to manufacture nuclear weapons on its own. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Well, we just mentioned the issue of the Russian-Iranian talks. </seg>
<seg id="32"> An Iranian government spokesperson indeed said on Monday that due to the new situation, it would postpone its talks with Russian officials scheduled for the 16th on uranium enrichment in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="33"> However, a Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson said that no official notification from Iran was received yet. </seg>
<seg id="34"> So, it is still yet too early to tell whether the meeting will be postponed. </seg>
<seg id="35"> In addition, Russia's Federal Atomic Energy Agency Director Kuchinov said on Monday that Russia is ready to have talks with Iran on the conditions and principle of the negotiations over the nuclear issue. </seg>

<seg id="1"> At the same time, the US New York Times recently published an editorial. </seg>
<seg id="2"> The title of this editorial is also very conspicuous.  It is called Japan's Offensive Foreign Minister. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Well, this editorial specifically mentioned that Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Aso recently made a string of appalling remarks. </seg>
<seg id="4"> These remarks were all very dishonest and very unwise.  Furthermore, the remarks have triggered widespread indignation among Asian countries. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Well, this editorial also specifically mentioned that Japan should acknowledge its mistakes and learn the lesson rather than avoid mentioning in post-WW II textbooks some of their deeds during the war as they are doing right now. </seg>
<seg id="6"> At the same time, the editorial also said that many of Taro Aso's current remarks, for instance, requesting the prime minister to visit Yasukuni Shrine, for instance, saying Taiwanese colonial rule raised, um, ah, the Japanese colonial rule raised Taiwan's educational level, and so on, it said such remarks were all very appalling.  Moreover, it is evident that he has no knowledge of history and is a very poor diplomat too. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Since the New York Times was the third largest newspaper in circulation in the United States last year, it should be very influential in the US society. </seg>
<seg id="8"> As a result, such an editorial should also be very influential. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In the meantime, some former senior US government officials and some US experts on Asian issues, they recently held a special forum, that is, a forum on Sino-Japanese relations. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Well, at this forum, some experts put forward this viewpoint. </seg>
<seg id="11"> It said that as current Sino-Japanese relations are under great tensions, there may be potential danger of military conflict. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Furthermore, it even said that now there is a greater possibility of a military conflict breaking out between China and Japan than between China and Taiwan. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Er, moreover, once the military conflict breaks out, it will surely drag the US into it because the US will surely get involved. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Well, a Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesperson also participating in the forum said that Sino-Japanese relations are now indeed under great tensions. </seg>
<seg id="15"> So, any mistake will lead to serious consequences. </seg>
<seg id="16"> On another note, the Georgian parliament's Defense and Security Committee held an expanded meeting and decided to expel the Russian peacekeeping force from South Ossetia. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The Russian parliament will hold a general assembly to review this bill today. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Er, experts think that if the parliament agrees to expel the Russian peacekeeping force, it may lead to the complete breakup of Georgian-Russian ties. </seg>
<seg id="19"> A spokesperson for the Russian peacekeeping force said on the 14th that two of the Russian peacekeeping contingent's military vehicles transporting foods were intercepted by Georgian police with the driver expelled. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Er, the spokesperson called for Georgia to stop immediately such provocations; otherwise Russia would assume no responsibility for the consequences of the incident. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Two military vehicles belonging to the logistic system of the Russian peacekeeping contingent transporting foods and groceries were examined by Georgian police Monday night in Georgia's South Ossetia. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Georgian law enforcement personnel on duty expelled the Russian driver and escorting personnel and forcibly drove away the two military vehicles. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The incident greatly angered the Russian peacekeeping force. </seg>
<seg id="24"> A spokesperson for the Russian peacekeeping force said that on February 1, Georgian police detained a Russian military vehicle in the area on an excuse of a traffic accident and has not returned it so far. </seg>
<seg id="25"> On February 8, three Russian military officers were detained for two days and nights on grounds of visa problems. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Georgia's reckless provocations were aimed to incur bloodshed in the area by forcing the Russian troops to open fire so that it could achieve the goal of the withdrawal of the peacekeeping force from South Ossetia. </seg>
<seg id="27"> On that day, the Russian embassy in Georgia made serious representations to the Georgian side, demanding Georgia to immediately stop frenzied provocations; otherwise the Russian side will not assume any consequence of the resulting conflict. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The media noted that on February 13, Georgian Defense Minister Okruashvili announced that the head of the Russian military base in Akhalkalaki sold several Strela portable air defense missile systems to South Ossetia. </seg>
<seg id="29"> On that day, the Georgian parliament Defense and Security Committee held an expanded meeting to hear a report by the law enforcement agency.  It decided to expel the Russian peacekeeping troops in Georgia and called for a review of this issue at the general assembly on the 14th. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Experts think that the final decision, once passed, may eventually lead to the complete breakup of Georgian-Russian ties. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Earlier, Georgian Foreign Minister Bezhuashvili vehemently criticized the Russian position and refuted Russian President Putin's remark that Russia may recognize Abkhazia and South Ossetia should the West recognize Kosovo.  He thinks that Russian authorities are sending an encouraging signal to all secessionist districts. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The Russian Foreign Ministry also announced earlier that it would protect Russian citizens in South Ossetia, implying a direct threat of military force to Georgia. </seg>

<seg id="1"> US Pacific Fleet Commander Roughead announced on Tuesday that this summer the United States will deploy four aircraft carriers to conduct the largest-ever military exercise in the Asia-Pacific region in ten years. </seg>
<seg id="2"> Roughead also said that the United States will, er, not consider, um, China, ah, a threat. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The US military is hoping to have another joint exercise with China's PLA Navy. </seg>

<seg id="5"> Heritage Foundation, a US think tank, held a forum on the Pentagon defense review report on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The subtle relationship between the defense report and the military exercise has become one of the focuses of discussion. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Some, however, think that Roughead's open invitation of China to participate in the military exercise was a sign of US friendship to China. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Since the US military also expressed hope for more transparency in China's PLA operations while inviting China to participate in the military exercise, some defense experts think that this shows the Pentagon's hope to sound each other out through the joint military exercise because it is not sure about the purpose of China's military expansion. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In addition, since the defense review report released by the Pentagon at the beginning of this month considered China the greatest potential threat, the two defense experts also pointed out that the Asia-Pacific military exercise is the first step that the US Department of Defense takes to adjust its strategy on this basis. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Xie Xiaoshuang reporting from Washington for Phoenix Satellite TV. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In addition, this time, this US military exercise in summer is drawing quite a lot of attention, because this is also, ah, the first time in a decade that the US has four aircraft carriers, ah, to participate jointly in a military exercise.  It is also the first time after the Vietnam War that the US deployed the aircraft carriers off the East Coast to do such a military exercise in this west Pacific Ocean region. </seg>

<seg id="54"> In addition, three engineering personnel also died in a bombing attack in Gwadar in May of the same year. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Let's have a recap. </seg>
<seg id="56"> On May 3, 2004, in the port of Gwadar in the southern part of the province of Balochistan, Pakistan, a vehicle carrying 12 Chinese was hit by a car bomb while it was driving to the port construction site. </seg>
<seg id="57"> In the end three Chinese engineering personnel died, while nine people were wounded. </seg>
<seg id="58"> This attack was believed to be launched by local separatists and tribal militias. </seg>
<seg id="59"> On October 9 of the same year, two Chinese engineers were kidnapped by gunmen in South Waziristan where Pakistan borders Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="60"> When Pakistani troops came to the rescue of the hostages later, one engineer was unfortunately shot to death. </seg>
<seg id="61"> However, armed groups linked with al-Qaeda rather than separatist militants were believed to be responsible for this hostage incident. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Since China has a close economic exchange with Pakistan and participates in Pakistan's infrastructure construction, quite a number of Chinese engineering personnel are working there. </seg>
<seg id="63"> Yet, tribal militias in Pakistan accused the government of robbing them of their natural resources. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Consequently, Chinese people have fallen victims several times to attacks and abductions. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Let's look at a few Japan-related news items. </seg>
<seg id="2"> Recently there has been a rather shocking piece of news in Japanese political circles. </seg>
<seg id="3"> That is, Tsuneo Watanabe, chairman of the Yomiuri Shimbun, the number one in the Japanese media, he ordered the Yomiuri Shimbun to publish some articles against Koizumi's visit to Yasukuni Shrine.  Furthermore, the Yomiuri Shimbun has since taken a position against Koizumi's visit to Yasukuni Shrine. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Er, well, um, Tsuneo Watanabe, he was lashing out against Koizumi in his speech a few days ago, saying he is very ignorant and has no knowledge of any history or culture. </seg>
<seg id="5"> At the same time he also said that visiting Yasukuni Shrine is like singing praises of Hitler.  In addition, he said that by doing so, Koizumi also made China and South Korea consider Japan a very dangerous country.  This is going to have no end of trouble. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Well, why could Tsuneo Watanabe, his attitude trigger great impact? </seg>
<seg id="7"> Actually, he is also very influential in political circles and has been a manipulator behind the scenes all along. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Yet, he used to be a very rightist figure. </seg>
<seg id="9"> We should say he had always supported hawks and also pushed vigorously for constitutional amendment. </seg>
<seg id="10"> But now, ah, this is really a big turn. </seg>
<seg id="11"> He now directed his attacks against Koizumi and started to oppose such a stance. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Actually in 2004 when someone attacked Koizumi for visiting Yasukuni Shrine, um, Tsuneo Watanabe, he still said, he said, er, he supported him and wanted Koizumi to resist the pressure. </seg>
<seg id="13"> However, he gave a speech recently.  He said, I am already more than 80 years old and don't have much time left. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Well, he has now adopted a high-sounding tone and taken on a kind of highly anti-war stance in his speech. </seg>
<seg id="15"> This kind of changing sides by him, of course, has a great social impact in Japan. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Just like Tsuneo Watanabe said himself, he said, I firmly believe I have the actual power of controlling and changing the political orientation. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Furthermore, he also said that should the Yomiuri Shimbun's freedom of speech and freedom of coverage and compilation be under the government pressure, he would resist it at the risk of his life. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Well, what kind of situation has it come to now? </seg>
<seg id="19"> That is, the Yomiuri Shimbun, the largest newspaper in Japan, and the Asahi Shimbun, the second largest newspaper in Japan, now these two large newspapers have started to join hands in opposing Koizumi's visit to Yasukuni Shrine. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Originally, these two large newspapers were opponents, but later when the two chairmen met, they at least reached consensus on this issue. </seg>
<seg id="21"> As a result, they now both launched massive attacks on Koizumi, forming what we could call a dream team. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Actually, these two large newspapers of theirs should have a very large influence on Japanese mainstream public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In addition, let's look at the meeting of Japan's House of Representatives.  At one of their recent meetings, two relatively popular candidates for successor to Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi made the same remark. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Who are these two people? </seg>
<seg id="25"> One is Chief Cabinet Secretary Shinzo Abe, and the other is Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Aso, who has made a series of appalling remarks recently. </seg>
<seg id="26"> What remarks did these two make? </seg>
<seg id="27"> They said that Japan's WWII criminals were not criminals. </seg>
<seg id="28"> What they meant was, er, it was the international court that has called them criminals and convicted them. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Whereas, in Japan, according to the international law, they were; according to the domestic law in Japan, er, the war criminals did not violate the domestic law of Japan. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Therefore, they think that WWII criminals should not be considered criminals in Japan. </seg>
<seg id="31"> At the same time, um, Shinzo Abe, he also mentioned that Japan should now focus its vision on the whole world and develop relations with the United States and develop commercial and trade relations with, um, some east Asian countries.  In addition, it should also try its best to develop close ties with India.  It should not always focus on China. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Championship Hopeful but not Assured </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> Love Life, Love Luneng </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> The fire will soon be lit on the battlefield of the Chinese Super League. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Luneng Taishan is getting ready for the new season and preparing to fight again for the championship. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The fight for the championship among Dalian, Shandong, and Shanghai is on the verge of breaking out. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Who will win the championship in the end? </seg>
<seg id="7"> Based on an analysis of strength, although the Taishan team has great hopes of winning the championship, it is not 100 percent assured. </seg>
<seg id="8"> First, new team members have little time to get adjusted. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The Taishan team had four major openings last year. </seg>
<seg id="10"> This year, following recruitment of the two famous national football players Li Leilei and Wang Liang, the Taishan team will soon be joined by two foreign players.  Its strength should be said to have increased without decreasing. </seg>
<seg id="11"> However, since the national team is preparing for matches with Palestine and Iraq, there has hardly been any coordination between the national team players and their teammates. </seg>
<seg id="12"> By the time they return to the team, the Super League will be starting. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Therefore, the problem of getting adjusted is the biggest problem the Taishan team now faces. </seg>
<seg id="14"> In my opinion, the national football players can serve as substitutes in the first few Super League matches. </seg>
<seg id="15"> First, the games can be used as practice to get the team adjusted. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Second, it can allow the players who have just finished two group matches with the national team to take a rest. </seg>
<seg id="17"> After sharpening their skills in several matches, it will not be too late to enter the battle. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The next problem is the hidden troubles on defense. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Last year, the Taishan team's defense was criticized by football fans. </seg>
<seg id="20"> This year, defense has been improved somewhat with the recruitment of Li Leilei, but it's not yet time to rest easy. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The central back still has a problem with turning around slowly, while the substitute players are either slightly old or lack sufficient experience. </seg>
<seg id="22"> If the central back can put forth a stable performance this year, then the Taishan team will have a greater chance of winning the championship. </seg>
<seg id="23"> I think it may be a good idea to use Ren Yongshun, who is in good physical shape.  Despite insufficient experience, he can test himself this year and prepare for the future. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In addition, it is also fine to recall Gao Yao to play sweeper. </seg>
<seg id="25"> There are quite a few members of the Taishan team who can play defensive midfield.  Both Cui Peng and Haibin can play. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Gao Yao, who is physically strong and fierce in intercepting the ball, should be able to do a good job as central back. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Also, whether the foreign players can adjust themselves... </seg>
<seg id="28"> Issues with foreign players have constantly been a big problem for the Taishan team. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Last year, Danciulescu's performance left much to be desired. </seg>
<seg id="30"> I know the foreign players for this year have not been determined yet. </seg>
<seg id="31"> I think that this year, in addition to recruiting an excellent striker, a pure left midfielder should be recruited. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Except for Xing Rui a few years ago, the Taishan team has not had a single true left-footed specialist. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Although Cui Peng and others are all competent, however, a real left midfielder is still much better than a stand-in. </seg>
<seg id="34"> If these three problems can be resolved well, the road to the championship for the Taishan team should be a bit smoother. </seg>
<seg id="35"> As a Shandong football fan, I hope very much that the Taishan team will win the championship this year. </seg>
<seg id="36"> However, to be honest, based on this year's competitive situation, the Taishan team has great hopes but there are few assurances. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Batey Ads Merges with JWT Network, Would It be Too Late to Say Happy New Year? </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> BrandVista Post: </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> Hello, everyone. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Once again Spring Festival is behind us.  Our friends who combined their vacation days with Spring Festival holidays are returning to their work. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Wish all friends a Happy New Year, if it is still not too late to say Happy New Year. </seg>
<seg id="6"> When I was chatting with NPLCN in a cafe the other day, he mentioned the current BrandVista. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The website has become much prettier. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The layout of the content is pretty good. </seg>
<seg id="9"> What he likes most is still the recent fully revamped Discuz-based community BBS. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Speaking of the community, I will have to thank one person. </seg>
<seg id="11"> That is Mr. Li Mingshun, general manager of Discuz Beijing company. </seg>
<seg id="12"> If you search for his name on Google, you can get a lot of hits. </seg>
<seg id="13"> I roughly know that he used to be at Sina and later started his own business, an internet ad exchange platform for small and medium-sized businesses, similar to adbrite.com abroad. </seg>
<seg id="14"> At that time he debated on MSN to the effect that Vista thinks that the development of many sectors in China all depends on private economy and growth of small and medium-sized businesses. </seg>
<seg id="15"> However, the situation in this respect in China's markets now is not encouraging. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Therefore, the creative media sector and the similar consulting sector serving small and medium-sized businesses are unable to grow into large scale. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Charging higher fees to facilitate its own development eventually led to an unfulfilling cycle. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Later he came to Discuz. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Discuz is an excellent community software based on PHP and MySQL database. </seg>
<seg id="20"> With the help of Ramboo, a technical engineer in Beijing, the BrandVista community finally saw hope again and emerged with a brand-new look. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The feedback is excellent. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The interface is clean-cut and friendly. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The speed is quite fast. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Writing some texts inspirational both to myself and to others on a freshly clean-cut interface and exchanging details in my work and life with friends of the same aspiration working in the same industry, I started to think this is a kind of happiness. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Thanks, Discuz! </seg>
<seg id="26"> There has been quite a lot of news lately in the advertising sector. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Starting from January, the WTO regulations on the liberalization of advertising went into effect. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Large foreign companies have been arriving at the scene, while smaller foreign companies are getting ready.  Prosperity seems to be everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Batey Advertising, which originated in Singapore, has encountered quite a lot of trouble. </seg>
<seg id="30"> After losing several heavyweight clients in a row and suffering a series of setbacks in its development in mainland China, Sir Martin finally found some time away from the lawsuit in Italy to think about reshuffling his cards. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Batey Advertising, Batey will merge with the JWT network while keeping its brand name under the JWT management. </seg>
<seg id="32"> In the meantime, there is rumor that Bates and the 141 network will soon merge with OgilvyOne and will be managed by the OgilvyOne ad network. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Though 141 earlier reported it to OgilvyOne, it would be interesting for Bates Asia to report it to OgilvyOne. </seg>
<seg id="34"> During the Spring Festival several articles have been updated on the website.  I will not go into details here. </seg>
<seg id="35"> You may go check them out on the website if you have time. </seg>
<seg id="36"> At the same time, those friends who have not entered the new forum may as well make an extra click to access the brand-new community at BrandVista </seg>
<seg id="37"> to experience the environment and atmosphere as well as to contribute some texts. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Hope you will feel the happiness of finding where you belong. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Wish all friends a beautiful state of mind. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Best wishes! </seg>

<poster>
<seg id="2"> Helen Li </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> I saw this article and want to share it with you. </seg>
<seg id="4"> This is not out of a momentary impulse but of warmth and kindness cherished long at heart. </seg>
<seg id="5"> I asked myself how I would act if it were me. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The answer was very clear.  I would put down the phone with a "You dialed a wrong number." </seg>
<seg id="7"> I have been thinking this year what exactly can be considered helping others. </seg>
<seg id="8"> I have already given up those momentary actions such as making monetary or material donations. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Two days ago, a friend said, I have already no time to take care of myself.  Even if I want to help others, I will not have the energy to do it. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Wish you a pleasant day :) </seg>
<seg id="11"> Helen </seg>
<seg id="12"> Mom Ten Years Ago </seg>
<seg id="13"> On that day ten years ago, when this teacher was taking a nap at home during noontime break, the telephone rang suddenly. </seg>
<seg id="14"> She picked up the phone and listened, yet out came a strange rough voice: "We have caught your kid stealing a book.  Come here quick!" </seg>
<seg id="15"> Coming from the other end of the line was a little girl's cryingï¼ along with loud scolding voices of others. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Glancing over at her only daughter, who was watching TV nearby, it suddenly dawned upon her. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Obviously, a little girl must have got caught by the sales person while she was stealing a book.  As she did not want to let her family know it, she must have made up a phone number at random.  That was how they happened to call here. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Of course she could put down the phone and ignored the call.  She could also even reprimand the other party, </seg>
<seg id="19"> because this incident had nothing to do with her. </seg>
<seg id="20"> However, being a teacher, she thought she might be her own student. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The phone call gave her some rough idea that the little girl, who made the momentary slip, must be very much frightened and was facing perhaps the most horrifying situation in her life. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Hesitating for a moment, an idea suddenly occurred to her.  Right, just do it this way. </seg>
<seg id="23"> So, after making sure about the bookstore's address, she hurried there. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Just as she expected, a tearful little girl was standing in the bookstore, </seg>
<seg id="25"> while adults nearby were yelling at her in fierce reproof. </seg>
<seg id="26"> She rushed up to hold the poor little girl in her arms.  Turning around, she said to the sales person nearby: "Talk to me.  Don't scare the kid." </seg>
<seg id="27"> Amid the sales person's reluctant mutterings, she paid the fine of about a few dozen yuan before she was able to lead this little girl out of the bookstore and take a close look at that tear-smudged, terrified face. </seg>
<seg id="28"> She laughed and took the little girl home.  She gave her a good cleaning and let the girl go without asking anything. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Before she took off, she made a special effort to tell her repeatedly, if you want to read books, just come to the auntie's place.  There are many books inside. </seg>
<seg id="30"> The little girl, who had still not yet recovered from her horror, took a close look at her and scampered away.  She never reappeared. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Time went by like a rushing stream.  Ten years had passed in a flash before she knew it. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Having long forgotten this thing, she still lived here, leading a quiet and peaceful life. </seg>
<seg id="33"> One day at noon, there was a series of knocks on the door. </seg>
<seg id="34"> When she opened the door, she saw a stranger, a pretty young girl with all smiles on her face and her hands full of gifts. </seg>
<seg id="35"> "Who are you looking for?" </seg>
<seg id="36"> She asked doubtfully. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In her excitement, that girl said a great deal. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Only with great efforts in following the narration of that girl, a stranger to her, did she suddenly realize that she was that little girl of that year.  She had graduated smoothly from college after ten years and now took this trip purposely to visit her. </seg>
<seg id="39"> With her eyes glistening with tears, the young girl said softly: "Though I have never understood even today why you were willing to pretend to be my mom to help me out, I have always felt all these ten years that I want to call you mom." </seg>
<seg id="40"> The teacher's eyes also grew blurry. </seg>
<seg id="41"> She asked curiously: "If I had not helped you, what would have happened?" </seg>
<seg id="42"> The girl's face immediately darkened.  She gently shook her head and said: "I am not sure.  I could have done something foolish and might have even committed suicide." </seg>
<seg id="43"> The teacher's heart trembled, and she started to feel rejoiced secretly. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The decision she made on the spur of the moment that year turned out to have had such an impact on one person's life. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Looking at the happy smile on the girl's face, she also smiled. </seg>
<poster>
<seg id="46"> Zhang xiwen </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="47"> When this world is filled with lies and fraud like junk text messages everywhere, Buddha said, if I don't go to hell, who else goes to hell. </seg>
<seg id="48"> If anyone has done this, then congratulations, because he could become Buddha earlier. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Human beings at their birth are naturally good. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Compassion lies in the heart of every human being. </seg>
<seg id="51"> The moral degeneration of the world is getting worse day by day.  People are not what they were in times past. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Perhaps only self-sacrificing Buddha can do some good deeds. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Observation on Military Situation: How Long Would Iran be Able to Hold on Against US Military Air Strikes? </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> Yun Feiquan </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> If we liken a traditional war of attrition to making the enemy bleed to death, then modern warfare is firing a bullet right into the enemy's head at the outset, turning it into a "vegetable" with no time to bleed. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The difference between Iran and the US in military power is not in the numbers but in their understanding of modern warfare. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Iran, which fought an eight-year war with Iraq without any distinguishable winner, does not seem to understand the real significance of modern high-tech warfare. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The British International Intelligence Review recently mentioned, after analyzing US military deployments, that US troops are preparing to launch a large-scale air strike on Iran... </seg>
<seg id="7"> The current status of the Iranian Air Force is rather worrisome. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The current status of the Iranian Air Force is very similar to the pre-war Iraqi Air Force in 2003. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The home country does not have the ability to develop modern weapons independently and is also under the arms embargo imposed by the West. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Upon the breakout of war, it is quite uncertain whether the old and outdated planes of the Iranian Air Force could take off and fight the US military. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Currently, Iran's air defense system is chiefly composed of the air force and land-based air defense force of Iran's regular military as well as the air defense force of the Revolutionary Guard Corps. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Among these, the Iranian Air Force is currently about 50,000 strong and has more than 300 fighter planes of various models. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The main plane models are US-made F-4 Phantoms, F-5 Tigers, and F-14 Tomcats, and Russian-made MIG-29s, among others. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The land-based air defense forces are mainly equipped with US-made Hawk, British-made Arrow, and some Russian-made Sam series surface-to-air missiles. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Analyzing the current status of the Iranian air defense forces, Harold Hutchinson, a US military expert, Khramchikhin, a military expert at Russia's Institute of Political and Military Analysis, and others think that looking at the current situation, there are still some holes in Iran's air defense capabilities and its air defense system construction. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Hutchinson thinks that in terms of overall real power, the Iranian Air Force is absolutely not at the same level as the US military. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The large number of US-made fighter planes Iran has are inoperable due to lack of spare parts, upgrades, and maintenance. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Of the F-14 fighters, once considered the trump of the Iranian Air Force, currently only 10-plus can take off. </seg>
<seg id="19"> It is also questionable whether the AIM-54 Phoenix missiles that they carry, which are said to have over-the-horizon attack capability, are reliable in actual battle. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Khramchikhin mentioned that the air defense missile systems that the US provided to Iran in the 1970s and 1980s have lost combat power due to lack of spare parts. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Some other non-system air defense weapons acquired from Russia and other countries are no match for the US military, which is capable of electromagnetic countermeasures. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Scraping it together has an effect on combat power. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The Iranian government obviously also realizes that its fate in war depends on its ability to defend the home skies.  In a last-minute effort to update its weaponry, it scraped together all it could get to reinforce its air defense system. </seg>
<seg id="24"> From what can be seen at present, its methods can be summarized into two. </seg>
<seg id="25"> First, work hard to conceal key nuclear facilities to enhance its capability to defend against attacks. </seg>
<seg id="26"> According to a report by the British newspaper the Times, Iran has concealed the core parts of nuclear facilities such as the Natanz nuclear plant and Isfahan uranium enrichment center as deep as 18 meters underground and encased them with 2-meter thick cement protection. </seg>
<seg id="27"> However, the US military is a step ahead, having seen the effects of underground bunkers during the 1991 Gulf war in defending against air strikes, it rushed development of various kinds of ground penetrating bombs. </seg>
<seg id="28"> After more than ten years of targeted research, the US military now has a complete package of combat methodology and weapons to deal with reinforced underground bunkers. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Iran has recently also bought large quantities of air defense weaponry from Russia. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Since the end of last year, the Iranian government has made successive agreements with Russia to purchase the Pechora-2A air defense missile system, along with 29 sets of the Tor-M1 air defense missile system worth 700 million US dollars. </seg>
<seg id="31"> However, modern warfare is a competition between systems. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The various air strike weapons of the US military were all developed independently by their own country.  Furthermore, after years of real war experience, they have been adapted into a set of impressive and effective war machines. </seg>
<seg id="33"> In contrast, whether the "new weapons" Iran gathered from other countries and put together can become a combat force within such short period of time is still an issue. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Iran is not lagging behind in weapons only. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The Army Field Manual published by the US military in 1982 proposed for the first time the doctrine of "Air Land Battle," which emphasizes attacking the enemy's deeply strategic and high-value targets using air superiority to paralyze the enemy's command system at the start of the war so that the enemy can become nothing more than "meat on the chopping board" no matter how powerful its regular military strength. </seg>
<seg id="36"> In the 1991 Gulf War, the 1999 Kosovo War, and the 2003 Iraq War, the US military cared not about how many planes the enemy had but the range of its own Tomahawk cruise missiles. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Although the Iranian government has been preparing for possible air strikes and has started taking measures to enhance its air defense capabilities, Iran, which fought an eight-year war with Iraq without any distinguishable winner, does not seem to understand the real significance of modern high-tech warfare. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Along with the US military's progress in recent years in military transformation work, the US military's air strike operations already completely differ from Vietnam War era carpet bombing, depending instead on various kinds of high-tech weapons and on modern information technology-based high precision and full depth air attacks. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Confronted with such air strikes, it is still unknown how long Iran's land-based air defense system would be able to hold on. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Joining Hands with Google in Battling Microsoft, Dell Charges Software Vendors "Shelving fees?" </seg>

<seg id="3"> Dell Inc. (US: DELL) and Google confirmed on Tuesday that Dell is testing personal computers that have installed Google Pack. </seg>
<seg id="4"> This move may pose a severe threat against Microsoft's (MSFT) dominant position in the PC software market. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Dell press spokesman Jess Blackburn indicated that the company is evaluating Google's software. </seg>
<seg id="6"> After installing this software, PC users can use the software to search the web as well as search for information stored on the PC. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Blackburn confirmed that at this time, the software being tested by the company include a Google-supported Dell homepage, Google Desktop Search, and Google Toolbar. </seg>
<seg id="8"> At the same time, Google press spokesman Jon Murchinson also confirmed that his company and Dell were testing a bundle of software developed by Google. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Earlier, the Wall Street Journal reported that IT upstart Google was in the process of negotiations with Dell and Hewlett-Packard Co., among others, in hopes of convincing these computer manufacturing giants to include Google software in their PCs. </seg>
<seg id="10"> According to insider sources quoted by the Wall Street Journal, Google may pay up to 1 billion US dollars to Dell over the next three years to achieve this goal. </seg>
<seg id="11"> However, the two companies did not reveal any of the relevant details. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In addition, Hewlett Packard refused to comment. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Microsoft press spokesman Neil Charney refused to comment on the above news. </seg>
<seg id="14"> As of now, Microsoft is planning to release its next-generation Windows operating system search tool and boost its development of web services. </seg>
<seg id="15"> On the day the news was released, Google's stock price again dropped by 4.46% to 367.92 US dollars. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Microsoft's stock price fell this day by 1%, closing at 26.94 US dollars. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Some analysts pointed out that Google is urgently seeking directions for growth outside of web search.  Joining hands with PC giants such as Dell may cause Google to threaten Microsoft's core business. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Matt Rosoff, an analyst from market research firm Directions on Microsoft, indicated that Google is in a rush to expand its revenue sources, which is definitely something Microsoft is concerned about. </seg>
<seg id="19"> However, some analysts are rather unimpressed. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Charles Di Bona, an analyst from market analysis firm Sanford C. Bernstein, pointed out that it is still too early for Google to shake Microsoft Windows' dominant position. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Reporter's note: Google Shaking Microsoft's Throne? </seg>
<seg id="22"> Huizhengyi </seg>
<seg id="23"> Computers have doubtlessly become a necessity for modern people in their life and work. </seg>
<seg id="24"> However, while everybody uses a computer skillfully, only a handful of people actually know the operating principle of a computer. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Just as using a "foolproof" camera, as long as the interface is friendly and software is easy to use, most beginners can equally feel comfortable operating such a black box as a computer. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Therefore, PC's manufacturer-installed original software will often determine the usage habits of most consumers. </seg>
<seg id="27"> It is exactly through this measure that Microsoft commands a solid control of the PC operating system market. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Now, Google, Microsoft's new rival, also intends to have its finger in the pie through this means. </seg>
<seg id="29"> A well-known economics media outfit recently used a very interesting metaphor for this. </seg>
<seg id="30"> "Dell, Hewlett Packard, and other computer manufacturers started to treat their computer products as supermarket shelves and charge software companies "shelving fees." </seg>
<seg id="31"> Winning bidders can have their software appear in the 'critical ten minutes' when users start their new computers so as to guide consumers to use their products. </seg>
<seg id="32"> This mode of charging fees resembles the way supermarkets charge food suppliers shelving fees." </seg>
<seg id="33"> Doubtlessly, this phenomenon indicates Microsoft's control is being loosened. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Microsoft's managers warned Bill Gates that if Google began to pay PC manufacturers to have their computers installed with Google software when they are shipped out, then Microsoft's hegemony will eventually be threatened. </seg>
<seg id="35"> No matter what will be the outcome of the situation, Microsoft's stable and easy days as number one may become history. </seg>
<seg id="36"> After all, it is easier to win the throne than to keep the throne. </seg>

<seg id="3"> Sword of Justice: Prospects for 2006 </seg>
<seg id="4"> Author: Sword of Justice </seg>
<seg id="5"> I remember that at the beginning of 2005, Hong Kong's Apple Daily published an article entitled "As Falun Wheel Revolves, its Contributions Rival Those of Government." </seg>
<seg id="6"> The article called 2004 a year of great advancement for Falun Gong. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The article gave many examples of how overseas CPC officials completely lost their manners in suppressing Falun Gong on various occasions, while Falun Gong practitioners told the truth all over the world, making the CPC completely lose face. </seg>
<seg id="8"> However, in comparison with the vast massive wave of withdrawals from the party triggered by the "Nine Commentaries" in 2005, the year 2004 did not seem impressive. </seg>
<seg id="9"> -Well, what will things be like in 2006? </seg>
<seg id="10"> From two incidents that occurred at the beginning of this year, we can probably see some clues about this year's developments. </seg>
<seg id="11"> One is the publication of "Eliminating Evils" by the Falun Gong founder.  This article announced the imminent doom of those who became CPC spies after July 20, 1999. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Perhaps many people are still skeptical about or cannot believe this article. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Yet, whether believing it or not, history and facts will be the proof! </seg>
<seg id="14"> Of course, CPC spies are like rats living in the sewer. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Their "natural or accidental" deaths won't rouse social or public attention. </seg>
<seg id="16"> But the widespread natural elimination of or repentance by CPC spies both at home and abroad will surely produce a powerful impact and shock to the CPC power structure. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Stunned and awed by the power of natural elimination, they will have to seriously consider their route of retreat and survival - withdrawal from the party, defection, or counterattack. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Consequently, "the CPC ultra stable bureaucracy group" maintained by filthy interests will start to shake, crumble, and collapse! </seg>
<seg id="19"> Another incident is the hunger strike protest movement initiated by Gao Zhisheng to safeguard human rights. </seg>
<seg id="20"> This movement, which started suddenly and was not regarded by people as having potential at the beginning, on the contrary received an unexpectedly enthusiastic response from around the world, and a joint response from various sectors and forces at that. </seg>
<seg id="21"> If this movement can become a tie to gather various forces of justice and the suffering masses, making it a widespread success, then there is hope that an external force will take shape from this to serve as the last straw for the unstable, evil CPC regime. </seg>
<seg id="22"> If we say 2005 was a year in which the CPC was destroyed spiritually, then 2006 will begin a phase in which the CPC will be eliminated both spiritually and materially. </seg>
<seg id="23"> With the further spread of the "Nine Commentaries" and the deepening wave of withdrawal from the party, with the internal collapse of the CPC and the convergence of external forces of justice, the life of the CPC devil will officially enter the count-down period. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The intent of heaven and the people is harmonious; the power of God and the people are converging. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The giant sword is pointing directly at the CPC devil. </seg>
<seg id="26"> If we say 2004 was a year of great advancement and 2005 was a year of surging momentum, then what will be the final conclusion for 2006? </seg>
<seg id="27"> I hope it is stunning transformation and triumph! </seg>

<seg id="5"> Subject: Xu Zhiyong: A Letter to Li Qun, Linyi Municipal Party Committee Secretary - Hooliganism May Also Harm Yourself </seg>
<seg id="6"> Mailing station: feel like old friends at the first meeting (Wed Feb 8 13:56:14 2006), this station (yjrg.net) </seg>
<seg id="7"> As of yesterday the Linyi government under your leadership had illegally put Chen Guangcheng under house arrest for 165 days. </seg>
<seg id="8"> You people have colluded with hooligans and underground society in taking illegal custody of a lawful blind citizen for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="9"> You people have cut off the phone line in his home and installed a cell phone interference device in his courtyard. </seg>
<seg id="10"> You people have also beat him and his family members several times. </seg>
<seg id="11"> You people's barbarism has exceeded the bottom line of a civilized society. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In early October 2005, you people acted like hooligans in the underground society and beat Attorney Li Fangping and me, but we put up with it, always trying our best to understand the difficulties you people are in.  We even acquiesced for some time after you people put Chen Guangcheng under house arrest. </seg>
<seg id="13"> However, 165 days have passed.  Instead of refraining yourself, you people even have become more unscrupulous. </seg>
<seg id="14"> You people dispatched regiments of police and hooligans to harass villagers. </seg>
<seg id="15"> You people continued to detain and beat villagers. </seg>
<seg id="16"> You people have gone too far! </seg>
<seg id="17"> Today, as you continue to organize hooligans in the underground society to hem in Chen Guangcheng, I remind you explicitly that acting as hooligans in the underground society may backfire and harm yourself. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Things at the very beginning should have warranted your reconsideration. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Family planning in Linyi ranked at the bottom in the entire province. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It was understandable that you felt somewhat worried as a municipal party committee secretary. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, you were wrong to think that people in Linyi are so crude that force must be used to implement the national law and policy. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Whose fault was it if citizens did not cooperate with the government's action? </seg>
<seg id="23"> Was it because citizens were crude or because the government has a poor public credibility as a result of its numerous lies and tricks over a long period of time? </seg>
<seg id="24"> If the same action by the government ten years ago did not appear that absurd, don't you think your barbarous action was way out of line in 2005 when the Chinese society had achieved remarkable progress and when the human rights protection had been written into the Constitution? </seg>
<seg id="25"> Why don't you reexamine yourself as to how it was that your Linyi alone dare do such things? </seg>
<seg id="26"> How could it be that your Linyi alone could not implement the law using the means of democratic rule of law? </seg>
<seg id="27"> After Chen Guangcheng and a number of brave citizens reported the truth about the barbarous way of implementing the law, after Teng Biao and a number of legal professionals daring to safeguard citizens' rights got involved, and after the National Family Planning Commission made the conclusion of the investigation, Linyi should have offered a sincere explanation to gain the understanding of the public. </seg>
<seg id="28"> After all, family planning is a tough subject with Chinese characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="29"> People could also have understood your difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Yet, you people instead adopted an absurd move - catching Chen Guangcheng in Beijing and bringing him back to be locked up.  You even attempted to incriminate him in the name of illegally supplying state secret intelligence. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Don't you think this criminal charge very absurd for a blind person living in a poor mountain village? </seg>
<seg id="32"> In fact, as long as you people have really corrected your mistakes and as long as you people have done a good job, would you be afraid of the criticism by a blind person? </seg>
<seg id="33"> Would you people find it necessary to dispatch tens of people to watch him 24 hours a day and even feel so exasperated as to convict him? </seg>
<seg id="34"> On October 4, 2005, Attorney Li Fangping and I went to Dongshigu Village.  We made our position very clear and hoped to resolve the contradiction. </seg>
<seg id="35"> We proposed that we could talk with your officials first to find out what idea and request you people had. </seg>
<seg id="36"> We offered to help you persuade Chen Guangcheng not to make certain remarks. </seg>
<seg id="37"> It was our hope that you people should not treat a blind person this way and that both sides should make some concessions. </seg>
<seg id="38"> However, your policy makers were bent on having your way, and furthermore, even "masterminded" an incident of beating and illegally detaining us. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Do you think you can scare us this way? </seg>
<seg id="40"> We have not done anything illegal. </seg>
<seg id="41"> We are not afraid of anything. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Although the rule of law in China is imperfect, it is not so bad as to allow lawlessness. </seg>
<seg id="43"> If you think you can scare us by using the tricks of hooligans in the underground society, then you have far underestimated our resolution and willpower. </seg>
<seg id="44"> As long as we want, we have many people who have many lawful reasons to go to Linyi or visit Chen Guangcheng. </seg>
<seg id="45"> You can beat attorneys and scholars once, twice, and three times.  Each time there will be widespread attention and coverage. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Do you people dare to beat us ten times? </seg>
<seg id="47"> Don't you care very much about your official position? </seg>
<seg id="48"> In case someone is injured by beating, is your position really that secure? </seg>
<seg id="49"> Playing some lowly tricks of hooligans instead of listening to our reasonable advice, don't you think this is not only foolish but also risky? </seg>
<seg id="50"> I want to tell you clearly that in China there is a large number of excellent citizens who follow their conscience and abide by the rule of law. </seg>
<seg id="51"> We are not afraid of hooligans and the underground society. </seg>
<seg id="52"> We cannot tolerate the reckless trampling of the bottom line of human civilization. </seg>
<seg id="53"> If you are going to the extreme, we will go toward your batons and sticks with confidence and ease in groups and by turns until the moment you retreat. </seg>
<seg id="54"> You should know clearly that using the tricks of hooligans in the underground society will not be of any good to you. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Don't think you can extricate yourself from those local ruffians and hooligans who beat up villagers as long as you stay behind the scenes. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Finally, I also want to remind you to treat Chen Guangcheng well. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Blind since a child, he graduated from a college of traditional medicine and taught himself law and English.  He once sued the Beijing subway company in the interest of the blind people, and he introduced running water for the villagers.  He is known far and wide as "Attorney Chen." </seg>
<seg id="58"> You people went so far as to have shameless villains create rumors online slandering him and even attempted to convict him of a crime of supplying confidential intelligence illegally to overseas recipients.  Don't you think you have gone too far by doing that? </seg>
<seg id="59"> It is illegal for you people to put Chen Guangcheng under house arrest.  It is also risky to you. </seg>
<seg id="60"> Originally, you people could have released him with no trouble. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Since the barbarous implementation of the law has stopped, how long will he go on criticizing if left unchecked? </seg>
<seg id="62"> But, you people are now continuing to smear your own image. </seg>
<seg id="63"> As long as Cheng Guangcheng is not free, you people will never have peace. </seg>
<seg id="64"> You people have tortured him enough. </seg>
<seg id="65"> If you even want to convict him or resort to further hooliganism, we will never look on with folded arms. </seg>

<seg id="3"> I am very disappointed to admit that the Chinese people do not deserve democracy! </seg>
<seg id="4"> Aren't the people posting here doing just that? </seg>
<seg id="5"> It is just a pity that not many people will read it online (compared with 1.4 billion). </seg>
<seg id="6"> Among netizens, even fewer people are concerned with or participate in topics like this.  I dare say it is less than 1% of netizens! </seg>
<seg id="7"> What's more, this network is equipped with the Golden Shield, the world's largest, most comprehensive, most advanced, most expensive, and highest quality project! </seg>
<seg id="8"> Indeed. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Depressed, disappointed, helpless, even thinking of submission, but if I want to live a human life, who else can I count on but myself to make it happen? </seg>
<seg id="10"> Though man proposes, God disposes; even if I failed...I would think that it is my fault and that I deserve to live like a dog if I have not tried hard for my own ideals. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The very act of working hard for justice will add some beauty to my own life, at least in my own heart, in my self-appraisal. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In fact I don't have to worry about the future of China at all. </seg>
<seg id="13"> That's because the global environment has made it impossible for the existence of a regime that has not held elections for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This is just a matter of time. </seg>
<seg id="15"> I only lament that the Chinese people have such luck that at turning points of history, they have always been led by devils of an international and monstrous stature on a road to hell along which your bones are beaten and your blood is sucked out of you.  Just to think that some people call glorious the bones of the dead and the puddles of blood along this road, and even force us to be proud of such glory. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Dark night falls everywhere, but it is the longest in the Divine Land of China. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The Qin Emperor plus the sage Confucius brought huge disasters to people. </seg>
<seg id="18"> While the First Qin Emperor openly ruled as a tyrant, the sage Confucius brainwashed in the shadows. </seg>
<seg id="19"> It is not that the Chinese people do not deserve democracy, it is that their democracy gene is gone, having been made to regress. </seg>
<seg id="20"> For a nation that has existed for more than three thousand years, this nation should have long practiced democracy if there was an element of democracy in its national culture. </seg>
<seg id="21"> When a democratic system was established in Athens, when a republic was founded in Rome, when the Magna Carta was approved by the British people, when the French people were issuing the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, and when Americans were issuing the Declaration of Independence, what were Chinese people doing? </seg>
<seg id="22"> Before the Mongols took control of the Central Plains, khuriltai were used to elect emperors.  The Manchus long ago had the Council of Princes and Ministers to practice democratic administration.  Why did it all evaporate once they came to the region of the Han people? </seg>
<seg id="23"> Chinese pursue material things and are not interested at all in spiritual beliefs and political rights. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Believe it or not, at the price of a stuffed pancake, Chinese people would sell you their universal suffrage if they had it. </seg>

<seg id="3"> Dalai's special envoys meet with Chinese officials behind closed doors. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The Dalai Lama stressed that he wants autonomy, not independence, for Tibet. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The special envoys of the Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader in exile, are having closed-door meetings with Chinese officials in Beijing with no details released. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This is the fifth official meeting between China and the Dalai's government-in-exile since contacts resumed in 2002. </seg>
<seg id="7"> However, as always, the two sides met behind close doors with no details revealed. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Reporters said that the two sides held talks several times but so far no substantive results have been achieved. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The Dalai Lama, who is in exile in northern India, said that he wants autonomy, not independence, for Tibet. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The Chinese side refused to comment on the bilateral talks. </seg>
<seg id="11"> However, analysts said that Beijing wanted to have the dialogue partly because it is worried that Tibetans' dissatisfaction with the Chinese rule may escalate should this 70-year-old spiritual leader in exile die. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Cultural Identity </seg>
<seg id="13"> The delegation of Dalai's government-in-exile was led by Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari, who was also chief representative to several previous talks. </seg>
<seg id="14"> A spokesperson for the Tibetan government-in-exile said that the several rounds of talks they had with Chinese officials in Switzerland in 2005 were very "close and frank," bringing hopes for Tibetans. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The spokesperson said that their ultimate hope is to resolve the relevant issues on the basis reached through negotiation with the Chinese leadership so that Tibetans will have the freedom to preserve their cultural identity, which they consider important. </seg>

<seg id="17"> Dalai Lama's Special Envoys Reiterate they do not Seek Tibet's Independence. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The Dalai Lama will go to visit Washington this month. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Prior to the Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama's visit to the United States on November 8, his special envoys said that the Tibetan government-in-exile would not demand for Tibet's independence. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari said in Washington that he hoped the Chinese government would indeed preserve Tibet's unique culture and tradition. </seg>
<seg id="21"> During his visit to the US next week, the Dalai Lama is expected to discuss the Tibetan issue with President Bush in hopes that Bush can urge the Chinese government to give Tibet genuine autonomy. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Dalai's representative had direct contact with Beijing officials for the first time in Berne in July of this year. </seg>
<seg id="23"> "Genuine Autonomy" </seg>
<seg id="24"> Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari noted that in recent years the Tibetan government-in-exile has seen some positive aspects when meeting with Chinese authorities. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The Dalai Lama's special envoys found that Beijing leaders, especially the representatives from the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, were more willing than before to hear their opinions. </seg>
<seg id="26"> However, Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari said that the Tibetan government-in-exile still has too many disagreements with the Chinese government and that there is a very big difference between the positions of the two sides. </seg>
<seg id="27"> He said that during the past five years the Tibetan government-in-exile has tried its best to meet the Chinese request for creating a good negotiation environment. </seg>
<seg id="28"> China should also create a good environment for negotiations on the Tibetan issue instead of suppressing the Dalai Lama unrelentingly. </seg>
<seg id="29"> He said that the Dalai Lama does not demand independence for Tibet.  Tibet is still part of China, but the Chinese government must preserve Tibet's unique culture so that "Tibetans will have genuine autonomy." </seg>
<seg id="30"> In addition, Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari noted that some Chinese think the Tibetan issue will disappear once the Dalai Lama dies. </seg>
<seg id="31"> He said that this idea is very dangerous because China will lose a historic opportunity to solve the Tibetan issue once the Dalai Lama passes away. </seg>
<seg id="32"> He said that as long as the Chinese government responds to the requests of the Dalai Lama and proposes a final resolution, the Dalai Lama will not need to talk about the Tibetan issue internationally. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Negotiation And Compromise are Important Democratic Methods! (ZT) </seg>

<seg id="2"> Houze </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> I just saw a post by a net friend on The Great Spirit: To Old Mr. Guiren. </seg>
<seg id="4"> His/her original words were "negotiation and compromise are important democratic methods, or else, splitting because of disagreements is the failure of democracy!!!  I hope idealistic democrats will pay full attention to this point!" </seg>
<seg id="5"> This bland remark that has not roused interest among any net friends led me to indulge in a train of thought while all sorts of feelings welled up in my mind. </seg>
<seg id="6"> At this time, I thought of ancient China as well as the past of the West. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Seldom posting topics, I could not help replying to the post of this net friend in the form of a topic post. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Let's take a look first at ancient China. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Everybody knows that beginning with the First Qin Emperor, China has constructed a large and unified centralized power system, with all dynasties that followed operating under this political framework. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Although a "double-track system" was temporarily implemented in the Han Dynasty, that is, a political system consisting of a dual coexisting feudal system and centralized power system, after all, there was still a centralized power system in the end. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The effect of this kind of centralized power system under the conditions at that time in history had its progressive side, had its aspect of promoting the development of forces of production. </seg>
<seg id="12"> However, we should also see that the prolonged period of more than 2,000 years of running this system resulted in a lack of creativity, initiative, and activity in local areas, making it even less possible to formulate, based on local conditions, various kinds of regulations and policies appropriate for local development. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The pyramid-like system of government also caused lower-level officials to only look upward, following every detail of orders from higher levels. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Since all local officials in the county government were appointed by the central government, they had no room for coordination and negotiation among themselves, let alone with those ordinary citizens. </seg>
<seg id="15"> When their rights were infringed upon, peasants in ancient China could do nothing but put up with it time and again. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Only when their most basic rights were threatened, that is, when their rights of existence were deprived by widespread famine, tyranny, and natural disasters, would they rise in revolt with sharpened sticks. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Over 2,000 years, several peasant uprisings spread like storms across the country, from the spontaneous Chen Sheng Wu Guang Uprising to the plotted Yellow Turban Uprising, to the Huang Chao Riot in the Tang Dynasty, as well as the one-month dynastic rule as a result of Li Zicheng's uprising.  Except for Zhu Yuanzhang, none achieved victory in the true sense of the word. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Even the Ming Dynasty established this way by Zhu Yuanzhang was still nothing but a rotating replacement of other dynasties, with no change in the system. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Born a commoner with little education, Zhu Yuanzhang implemented ancient China's centralized power system to a sickening extreme.  The brimming vitality characteristic of the Tang Dynasty, born of openness, freedom, and tolerance, was replaced by stagnant lifelessness. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The free speech atmosphere vanished from the land of China for some time. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Human nature suffered utmost suppression. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Everyone became overcautious and dared not talk too much, from fear and trepidation. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The result of this sole successful peasant uprising over 2,000 years turned the Chinese people into subhuman beings for a period of time. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Now let's take a look at the Middle Ages in Western Europe, known as the Dark Ages. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The Middle Ages in Western Europe was a period of one thousand years which came about after Western Rome was destroyed by nomads and had nothing to do with the previous ancient Greece and Rome. </seg>
<seg id="26"> This period was characterized by fiefdoms, namely land fiefdoms. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Landlords at lower levels had more independent power. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Whether they were small feudal lords with territories extending a few kilometers or the nobility of dukes, marquises, counts, viscounts, and barons who appeared on formal occasions, as people of various ranks were able to mutually check and balance and depend on one another, with the conditions and abilities to fight for their legitimate rights from the king, there were scenes of kings and noblemen sitting together for negotiations of their own respective interests, scenes never seen in ancient Chinese history. </seg>
<seg id="29"> They made mutual compromises and concessions instead of overthrowing or superseding other parties by using force. </seg>
<seg id="30"> This way, by means of various kinds of contracts, rights were continuously granted to noblemen and commoners, and with increasing power for noblemen and commoners, the king's rights became increasingly diminished. </seg>
<seg id="31"> In the end, the British queen became only ceremonial, with no actual power. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Democracy was gradually realized through this method! </seg>
<seg id="33"> Let's come back to make a comparison with ancient China, with all power centralized in the hands of the emperor (except for Li Shimin) and with almost no noblemen.  It would be hard for peasants to sit with the king at the negotiating table over a cup of tea and a glass of wine, making mutual compromises and concessions in a relaxed and pleasant manner and formulating contracts to the satisfaction of the two sides. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Under such circumstances, when the right of existence was deprived, the only way remaining was to overthrow the existing dynasty by force and try to replace it. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Consequently, there was a repeated rotation, from the heyday of the Tang Dynasty to the morbidity of the Ming Dynasty. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Comparing Chinese history with Western history, we find there seems to be no Western country where conflict between the ruler and the ruled was as aggravated as it was in ancient China. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In no Western country were peasant uprisings as frequent as in ancient China. </seg>
<seg id="38"> In Western countries, when conflicts between ancient royal households and peasants arose, noblemen and commoners would first think of achieving resolution through negotiations to protect their own interests.  They would make some mutual concessions to gradually win more rights, while force was rarely used. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Understanding this, you will see that even as we enter the 21st century, some democratic "fighters" on the internet, having inherited the idea of the ultra, absolute totalitarian system of the Ming Dynasty, </seg>
<seg id="40"> and also because their bodies are eroded by the poison of the Cultural Revolution, these democratic "fighters" can talk about nothing except annihilation and overthrow. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Yet it is this kind of ideology that is the largest obstacle to democracy, because these people don't understand that negotiation, consultation, and compromise are the most important methods and approaches for realizing democracy. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Cao Xiaoming: Who Foots Bill for Enriching Rural Cultural Activities? </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> Houze </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> This Spring Festival, this writer was lucky enough to spend the holiday in rural China and visit some relatives and friends. </seg>
<seg id="4"> While impressed by the rich festive atmosphere in rural China, I was also concerned with the drab cultural activities in the countryside. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This writer found in one village with friends and relatives that previously at Spring Festival each year, this village would spontaneously organize villagers to put on a local theatrical show called "Revolving Lantern." </seg>
<seg id="6"> Both adults and children could play roles in this show based on characters in the Three Warring Kingdoms.  The villagers never grew tired of watching it. </seg>
<seg id="7"> There were several performing teams for "Revolving Lantern" across the township.  They not only performed in their own villages but also visited other villages, creating liveliness through their exchanges. </seg>
<seg id="8"> However, this year this village no longer organized it. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It turned out that a large sum of money was needed for purchasing costumes alone for "Revolving Lantern."  In the past, costumes were bought through fund raising among the villagers, yet they are now too worn out to wear. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Asking villagers door to door for money again, nobody wanted to do it.  Similar situations also occurred in several other villages across the township. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Without the "Revolving Lantern," the village suddenly became cold and cheerless. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Adults started to play mahjong. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Children also started to play poker. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Villagers all said there was nothing going on for this New Year festival. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Setting off firecrackers or playing mahjong has now become one of the major features of the New Year celebration in rural areas. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Meanwhile, gambling persists in spite of numerous bans and is tending to spread further.  Winning or losing as much as 10,000 yuan in a single game has even become commonplace.  In particular, a large number of peasants returning from their migrant jobs outside have become major players at gambling houses. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Their money earned by their own sweat over a whole year thereby goes down the drain. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In addition, gambling-related family disputes frequently occur.  Some even lead to tragedies of divorce and death. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Some peasants say they gamble not only during the New Year festival, but also frequently participate in gambling during the slack season. </seg>
<seg id="20"> There is no place to go if they don't gamble. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It is too difficult to organize some cultural activities, to find some fun in rural areas. </seg>
<seg id="22"> There are neither facilities nor funds, but also there are no people acting as organizers. </seg>
<seg id="23"> However, in this regard, what Jiangxi has done is doubtlessly good news for peasants. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In order to enrich the cultural life of the peasant population, the Jiangxi provincial government, starting in September of last year, not only implemented "theatrical performances funded by the government, operated by the market, supported by townships, provided for peasant enjoyment," </seg>
<seg id="25"> but is also allocating at least 60 million yuan annually to a special fund for rural cultural enterprises, so as to bring high-quality cultural products to the rural population. </seg>
<seg id="26"> At the start of the new year, 10 million yuan was again added, bringing the total amount to 100 million yuan for the establishment of the special fund for rural cultural enterprise. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Moreover, the "bills" paid with this special fund are for real benefits: </seg>
<seg id="28"> inviting various kinds of professional artistic troupes to stage performances in rural areas, with at least four performances per year in each township; </seg>
<seg id="29"> inviting various movie theater companies to dispatch teams to put on movies in rural areas, with at least six dramas and educational science movies per year in each administrative village; </seg>
<seg id="30"> organizing and carrying out mass cultural activities with local characteristics, with at least 2-3 events per year in each township. </seg>
<seg id="31"> From this "purchase inventory list," it is easy for us to see that the government is not simply providing funds, but trying its best to think about how to use the limited funding to provide what is most needed and to bring value-added cultural enjoyment for the vast rural population.  It has done a real job. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Currently, the vast numbers of peasants are rejoicing about being exempt from paying grain tax to the government. </seg>
<seg id="33"> If the government can do what Jiangxi did to "foot the bill" for enriching rural people's cultural activities, it will be another joy from heaven for peasants. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Furthermore, this "joy" will not only get peasants away from the mahjong table but also get them "active" in cultural activities, which helps add contributions to the construction of new socialist rural areas. </seg>

<seg id="1"> False Alarm: Wang Peirong's Child Almost Got Kidnapped </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> peirongwangsohu@gmail.com </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> Wang Peirong's child almost got kidnapped, but it turned out to be a false alarm. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Some time after 9:00 p.m. on January 24, 2006, Wang Peirong's child gave a full account: </seg>
<seg id="5"> On the morning of January 24, 2006, Wang Peirong's child was called out by the entrance guard when she was attending a make-up class in physics in the Xuzhou No. 3 Middle School. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The entrance guard told Wang Peirong's child that three unidentified men said to the No. 3 Middle School entrance guard, Wang Peirong's child Wang Tianjiao has not been home for three days due to her parents' quarrel. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Now her mother has disappeared.  As we are the leaders at her mother's workplace, we want to go inside the No. 3 Middle School to take away Wang Peirong's child. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Wang Peirong's child said to the entrance guard that what these three men said were all lies, and she refused to go with these three men. </seg>
<seg id="9"> With the help of the No. 3 Middle School entrance guard, Wang Peirong's child was not taken away. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Wang Peirong's child called her mother's leader at noon to investigate this incident, and that leader denied having sent anyone to the Xuzhou No. 3 Middle School. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Wang Peirong's child got her father's leader's telephone number from her. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Wang Peirong's child called her father's leader. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Wang Peirong's child said: "Three people came to the No. 3 Middle Scholl and wanted to take me away." </seg>
<seg id="14"> That leader asked: "Why didn't you go with them?" </seg>
<seg id="15"> Wang Peirong's child answered: "I will surely die if I go with them." </seg>
<seg id="16"> After saying that, Wang Peirong's child hung up the phone. </seg>
<seg id="17"> After hearing what Wang Peirong's child said, Wang Peirong felt it was a serious case and reported it to police. </seg>
<seg id="18"> On January 25, the feedback from the police station was that what Wang Peirong's child had said was basically true. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The police station asked the security department of the China University of Mining and Technology whether it had sent anyone to find Wang Peirong's child at the No. 3 Middle School.  The answer was no. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The police station again asked the CUMT security department whether the work unit affiliated with CUMT had sent anyone to find Wang Peirong's child at the No. 3 Middle School.  The answer was another no. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The relevant department asked others to tell Wang Peirong and his family to pay attention to their safety. </seg>
<seg id="22"> After the incident, the leaders of the relevant departments in Xuzhou City took it seriously. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Through the criminal investigation department of the Xuzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, the possibility of child kidnapping was ruled out. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Wang Peirong thanked the leaders of the relevant departments in Xuzhou City as well as the criminal investigation department of the Xuzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau. </seg>
<seg id="25"> This was a false alarm, and the false alarm was probably caused mainly by the No. 3 Middle School entrance guard. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The criminal investigation department of the Xuzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau has now confirmed:  On January 24, three people including the leader from the School of Science, Wang Peirong's workplace, could not find Wang Peirong by phone.  As they urgently needed to find Wang Peirong (Wang Peirong has so far no idea what that was about), they thought of going to the No. 3 Middle School to find the teacher of Wang Peirong's child so as to ask whether the child was in Xuzhou. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Heavy Topics:  Why is There Lower Risk to Engage in Corruption while cost of Anti-corruption is Higher? </seg>
<seg id="28"> http://bbs.people.com.cn/bbs/ReadFile?whichfile=44796&typeid=39 </seg>
<seg id="29"> With the current cadre mechanism and the anti-corruption mechanism, a corrupt official need only worry about a handful of relevant officials who supervise him rather than the vast majority of the masses. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Therefore, once he thinks he has successfully hoodwinked or balanced those few officials who can control his fate, he will feel safe in carrying out his great cause of corruption and wealth accumulation unscrupulously and at will,  disregarding how the people close to him feel. </seg>
<seg id="31"> In contrast, when ordinary people with no power in their hands take the lead in combating corruption at the sight of an injustice, they may likely be met with extremely cruel retaliation and revenge. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Or they may be also politically labeled against and may anytime suffer the fate of dying before the battle has won. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Comparing the two: those who practice corruption take less risk while those who combat corruption bear the high cost instead. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Now let's look at Iran's nuclear issue. </seg>
<seg id="2"> The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed on the 6th that the Iranian government had written to the agency requesting the removal of all equipments that monitor Iran's nuclear facilities by the middle of the month. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Since the IAEA decided to report Iran's nuclear issue to the UN Security Council, Iran had announced the termination of all supportive and cooperative measures it had adopted in the nuclear issue, and refused to allow the IAEA to conduct any further surprise inspections of its nuclear facilities. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Speaking on the tension in Iran's nuclear issue, Russia's Foreign Minister Lavrov stated in Athens, Greece, on the 6th that the collaboration between Russia and Iran still exists. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This will be the driving force in resolving Iran's nuclear issue. </seg>
<seg id="6"> A spokesman for Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs claimed on the same day that Russia's proposal to Iran on building a joint uranium enrichment enterprise in Russia is still effective. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The two parties may hold discussions on this issue next week. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On the same day, Lugar, the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman, indicated at the UN Headquarters in New York that the United States disagreed with Israel's attack on Iran's nuclear facilities. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Recent reports claimed that Israeli defense experts said that the Israeli air force may deliver a heavy blow to Iran's nuclear facilities if necessary. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The Xinhua News Agency reported that Kislyak, Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister, stated on the 7th that Russia is willing to cooperate with Iran on the nuclear issue, assisting Iran to obtain the legitimate right to peacefully develop nuclear power. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Kislyak said that Russia's proposal on a joint uranium enrichment enterprise with Iran is still effective. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Russia hopes to discuss the issue with Iran soon. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Russia submitted a proposal to Iran on building a joint uranium enrichment enterprise in Russia at the end of last December. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The European Union and the United States both indicated that they could accept this compromise plan. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Iran hopes that Russia can continue to revise the original plan. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Kong Quan, spokesman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said on the 7th that even though the IAEA had reported Iran's nuclear issue to the UN Security Council, it had not shifted its responsibility to handle Iran's nuclear issue to the UN Security Council. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Thus, all parties still have to break the stalemate of Iran's nuclear issue within the IAEA's framework. </seg>
<seg id="18"> According to the IAEA resolution, the agency's Director-General ElBaradei will submit a report on Iran's nuclear issue to the UN Security Council in March. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The UN Security Council will make a final decision after evaluating the report. </seg>
<seg id="20"> We believe this resolution is asking Iran to fulfill its obligations and commitments, but it is not transferring the IAEA's responsibility on handling the Iran nuclear issue to the UN Security Council. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Recently, China has been seeking peaceful resolutions to Iran's nuclear problem through diplomatic channels for some time. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Kong Quan said that Zhang Yan, Director-General of China's Department of Arms Control and Disarmament at the Foreign Ministry, had held talks on Iran's nuclear issue with Larijani, Secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council and chief negotiator, in Tehran on February 1. </seg>
<seg id="23"> China hopes that Iran will take great stock in the emphasis of the international community and create conditions for a peaceful solution to Iran's nuclear issue. </seg>
<seg id="24"> To solve the Iranian nuclear issue within the IAEA framework serves not only China's interest, but also the interest of all parties concerned. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Therefore, we again call on the parties concerned in the international community not to quit the diplomatic effort that has been conducted on this issue. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Hamas, which is in the process of establishing the new Palestinian autonomous government, officially announced that the Cabinet list of the new government is ready, except for the Prime Minister candidate. </seg>
<seg id="2"> This had caused various speculations on the Prime Minister candidate. </seg>
<seg id="3"> A senior Hamas official revealed to the Associated Press on the 8th that Hamas plans to nominate al-Khudairi, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Islamic University in Gaza and ((businessman)), as the new Prime Minister of the  autonomous government, but the nomination has not been formally presented to Abbas. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Al-Khudairi, 50, ran in the Palestinian Legislative Council elections as an independent candidate last month with the support of Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Al-Khudairi never mentioned anything relating to violence or anti-Israel in his public address. </seg>
<seg id="6"> However, he had mentioned that internal reform is needed for Palestine. </seg>
<seg id="7"> A senior delegation from Hamas is currently visiting Cairo to discuss with Egypt the issue of Hamas' establishment of the new Palestinian government. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Khaled Mashaal, a member of the delegation, told the press on the 8th that despite the continuous pressure from the international community and some Arab countries, the Palestinian government led and established by Hamas will not recognize Israel. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Mashaal also issued a warning to Abbas in his statement not to change the structure of the Palestinian leadership without consulting Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Analysts believe that this was a response to Abbas's plan to appoint Interior Minister Youssef as deputy commander of the Palestinian security forces. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In regard to the establishment of the new Palestinian autonomous government, Mashaal declined to confirm Hamas' plan to name al-Khudairi, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Islamic University in Gaza and ((businessman)), as the Prime Minister of the government. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Mashaal said, "We have not decided who we will name as Prime Minister." </seg>
<seg id="13"> Before Mashaal reiterated the refusal to recognize Israel, Marzuk, another Hamas political leader, stated during an interview with an Egyptian television station that Hamas will never recognize the legitimacy of Israel, but the new government will keep in touch with Israel in all areas since recognizing Israel and dealing with them are two different things. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Territorial issues have always been a staggering problem in the Israel-Palestinian relationship, despite all the old and recent grudges between the three Hamas Prime Minister candidates and Israel. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Olmert, acting Israeli Prime Minister, said during an interview with Israel's Channel 2 TV on the 7th that Israel has to separate from Palestine through the drawing of permanent borders. </seg>
<seg id="16"> This implied that Israel must withdraw from parts of the West Bank territory. </seg>
<seg id="17"> However, Olmert stressed that Israel will maintain control of the Jewish settlement blocs in the West Bank and the Jordan River Valley, and will retain a united Jerusalem. </seg>

<seg id="12"> The attack happened in the town of Hub, southeast of Quetta. </seg>
<seg id="13"> On that day, six Chinese engineers who worked at a local cement factory were in a car returning to their residences from their work site. Their car was suddenly stopped by some unidentified gunmen on motorcycles. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The gunmen opened fire with assault rifles, killing three engineers. </seg>
<seg id="15"> After the attack, a tribal militant group named the Baloch Liberation Army claimed responsibility for the shooting. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement that night, strongly condemning the attack, calling the incident a terrorist act. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The three Chinese killed were Long Hongbao, Wei Jianping, and Zhao Bin. They were engineers from the Hefei Cement Industry Design and Research Institute of Anhui under the Headquarters of the China National Building Material Group Corporation. </seg>

<seg id="24"> Chen Jian, Assistant Minister of Commerce, said that if work safety cannot be guaranteed for the time being, the project at the cement factory will not resume. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Only when the safety of the workers is guaranteed will they continue with the project. </seg>
<seg id="26"> After the forming of the ((emergency)) task force, we immediately, er, instructed the frontline personnel to rush to the scene to investigate the local situation. </seg>
<seg id="27"> We also confirmed the identities of the victims within the shortest time in China. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Chen Jian claimed that the Ministry of Commerce will follow the handling of the incident closely and will actively coordinate the handling of the aftermath among relevant units. </seg>
<seg id="29"> If work safety cannot be guaranteed, we would request the Chinese enterprise to stop its work. </seg>
<seg id="30"> We will resume work only after the work safety is truly guaranteed. </seg>

<seg id="26"> Er, these are what I know about the situation so far. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Great. Thank you for your live coverage, Li Guangyu. </seg>

<seg id="46"> what account of the investigation progress did they give at the communication meeting held earlier? </seg>
<seg id="47"> Oh, sure. </seg>
<seg id="48"> As you said, an hour ago, the police chief named Yakubu from Balochistan province, Pakistan - the province where the incident happened - came to the Chinese Consulate General in Karachi to inform, er, our Ambassador to Pakistan and the Consul General about the investigation into the incident conducted by the Pakistani police over these two days. </seg>
<seg id="49"> He gave a brief account on, er, the main leads and targets that the Pakistani police are following in the murder investigation in his report. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Er, they maintained that the incident should be the act of outsiders, but had definite ties with some local residents. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Well, now they are focusing their attention on er, er, employees who have work ties with the company that the Chinese engineers worked for. </seg>
<seg id="52"> They believed that these people might have provided, er, some clues, offered some information to the murderers, for example, information on when the Chinese engineers left and when they went to certain places. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Danish Prime Minister Rasmussen held a press conference at the Prime Minister's residence on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="2"> He stated that extremists are exploiting the cartoon incident regarding Mohammed, the founder of Islam, that has developed so far. </seg>
<seg id="3"> He ((said)), "Denmark respects all religions. And we believe in equal rights for everyone. Er, we appeal to the Muslims to exercise restraint and not to resort to violence." </seg>
<seg id="4"> Prime Minister Rasmussen and the Foreign Minister held a press conference at the Prime Minister's residence at 4:30 p.m. on the 7th. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Rasmussen said, </seg>
<seg id="6"> "The violent attacks on several European embassies demonstrate that this is not a matter between the Muslim countries and Denmark alone. </seg>
<seg id="7"> It is of utmost importance to my government and the Danish people that we receive widespread international support on this difficult situation. </seg>
<seg id="8"> We ally with France. </seg>
<seg id="9"> We are working in close cooperation with friends and allies in Europe and the United States, as well countries and organizations in the Muslim world. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Just a few minutes ago, US President Bush called me. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The President called to express support and solidarity with Denmark." </seg>
<seg id="12"> Rasmussen said, "We agreed that the way ahead is through dialogue and tolerance, not violence. </seg>
<seg id="13"> And we emphasized that freedom and democracy, and respect for all faiths, are crucial values. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Today I want to appeal to all people in the Muslim countries: Let us work together to stop the violent attacks from expanding. </seg>
<seg id="15"> We need to solve this issue through dialogue, not violence. </seg>
<seg id="16"> We are today facing a growing global crisis </seg>
<seg id="17"> We saw Danish flags being burned and Danish embassies being attacked. </seg>
<seg id="18"> We saw that Danish people were characterized as intolerant people, or as enemies of Islam. </seg>
<seg id="19"> That is incorrect. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Extremists and radicals who seek a clash of cultures to magnify the incident." </seg>
<seg id="21"> Rasmussen stressed, "Denmark and the Danish people are not enemies of Islam or any other religion. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Danes have for generations pursued human rights, democracy, and freedom beyond politics. </seg>
<seg id="23"> We will continue to do that. </seg>

<seg id="29"> NTDTV reporter Li Luo, reporting from %pw, Copenhagen, Denmark. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Iranian extremists angered by the publishing of the Mohammed cartoons attacked the Danish embassy in Tehran again and threw firebombs on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Meanwhile, an Iranian state-run newspaper held a Holocaust cartoon contest in retaliation. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The United States condemned the act as an exploitation of the opportunity to strengthen the prolonged presumptuous anti-Israel position of the Iranian President Ahmadinejad. </seg>
<seg id="33"> About 20 to 30 protesters climbed over the fence and entered the Danish embassy in Iran. </seg>
<seg id="34"> In addition, as many as 300 people threw stones and firebombs outside the compound. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The day before, student members of Iranian hard-line militia groups led several hundred protesters in attacking the Danish and Austrian embassies in Tehran. </seg>
<seg id="36"> The controversial cartoons were first published by the Danish daily Jyllands-Posten last September. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Other European press and three Arab newspapers reprinted the cartoons, one after another. </seg>
<seg id="38"> In a tit-for-tat move, Hamshahri, the most-circulated newspaper in Iran, announced earlier that it will hold a Holocaust cartoon contest. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The action was condemned by countries including the United States. </seg>
<seg id="40"> McCormack, spokesman for the U.S. State Department, said he saw the initiative by Iran's largest-selling paper as an extension of Iranian President Ahmadinejad's campaign of virulent anti-Israeli rhetoric. </seg>
<seg id="41"> McCormack reiterated US support for freedom of expression throughout the world, including in Iran. </seg>
<seg id="42"> But he saw no comparison between the plans for a cartoon contest by Hamshahri and the move by Danish media to publish the Mohammed cartoons. </seg>
<seg id="43"> McCormack said, "I don't think that anybody would draw any equivalences between, quote/unquote, 'freedom of the press' in Iran and freedom of the press in Western Europe or the United States." </seg>
<seg id="44"> Ahmadinejad once drew widespread criticisms from the United States and other countries for dismissing the Holocaust as a myth and urging the wiping of Israel off the map. </seg>
<seg id="45"> McCormack suggested that Hamshahri was financed by Tehran's conservative metropolitan government. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Holding the cartoon contest at that time was no coincidence. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Shortly after the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) decided to hand over Iran's nuclear issue to the UN Security Council, Iran reiterated that there is no room for negotiation with the United States, one of the advocates. </seg>
<seg id="2"> Er, a spokesman for the Iranian government stated on Monday that it has maintained its policy toward the United States of non-discussion and non-negotiation on its relationship with the other party. </seg>
<seg id="3"> He said that it was a huge mistake for the West to hand the nuclear issue over to the UN Security Council, showing that the West is blocking Iran's development. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Iran said on Sunday that it will end the cooperation with the IAEA, resume refining enriched uranium, and ban surprise inspections of nuclear facilities. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Iran's attitude toward this issue is quite strong, while the US position is even stronger. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Er, Rumsfeld, US Secretary of Defense, has stressed repeatedly that the use of violence cannot be ruled out in this issue. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Well, now there is a rumor that the US military is actually executing such a plan. </seg>
<seg id="8"> They are developing an ultra-large mother of a bomb. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Er, this ultra-large bomb will be used to bombard Iran once the Department of Defense gives the order. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Then, how big is this mother of a bomb? </seg>
<seg id="11"> Allegedly, its weight alone is 30,000 lbs, the equivalent of a double-decker bus. Er, moreover, its volume is huge. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Well, the development of such a super bomb is mainly for the bombing of Iran's underground facilities. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Due to its extremely strong penetrating force, it can penetrate cement and sheet steel, and will probably create a large pit of 60 feet by 0.5 mile, er, and will destroy many underground buildings and facilities. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Well, from what we see, it seems that the United States has actually started to sharpen its weapons or produce bombs at the last moment. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Rumsfeld claimed that he does not rule out any means in this issue, in resolving Iran's nuclear issue, and forcible means have been put on the table. </seg>
<seg id="16"> On the other hand, Iran's nuclear issue, issue continues to aggravate. Well, er, a relevant Iranian official in China said during an interview with our station that Iran will indeed insist on adopting a peaceful negotiation method to cooperate with the international community, er, hoping to alleviate the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="17"> However, he also indicated that Iran will adjust the content of the nuclear cooperation project with Russia. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Speaking on the second round of negotiations with Russia on the enriched uranium project on February 16, Iran said that the negotiation will be held as scheduled, but emphasized that some adjustments will be made in the negotiation content due to the changes in the current situation. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Russia had shown its support for Iran's peaceful utilization of nuclear power, and stated that it would insist on not handing over Iran's nuclear issue to the UN Security Council. </seg>
<seg id="20"> However, we saw that they have already agreed to hand over Iran's nuclear issue to the UN Security Council. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Now that we have such a new development, we may therefore amend the previous agreement we reached with Russia. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Before the UN Security Council makes its final decision on whether to impose economic and political sanctions on Iran in March, Iran suggests holding continuous talks with relevant international organizations. It is also willing to cooperate with the international community in order to alleviate the current crisis. </seg>
<seg id="23"> We stress that Iran will not give up the rights to peaceful use of nuclear power in order to strive for our economic development and the building of our country. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Iran has not violated relevant international law. We hope that the United States can understand. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Iran's nuclear issue is completely different from the Afghani and Iraqi issues. </seg>
<seg id="26"> I think the United States is also clear on this. </seg>
<seg id="27"> As for the so-called military attack, we have not seen a clear position from the United States. </seg>
<seg id="28"> We do not want to see the escalation of the crisis. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Let's look at some news on Japan. </seg>
<seg id="2"> Er, Koizumi has always wanted to upgrade the Japanese Defense Agency to a ministry to increase Japan's military power. </seg>
<seg id="3"> However, intense debates have been created during the course, and it is full of twists and turns. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Recently, scandals surfaced during the bidding, during the bidding on construction projects at the Defense Facilities Administration Agency under Japan's Defense Agency, leading to the arrest of existing and former officials. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Therefore, many people advised Koizumi to be careful in the course of upgrading the agency to a ministry. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Well, Koizumi stated recently that he will temporarily shelve the plan and will not submit it to the Cabinet for deliberation for the time being. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Well, he hopes that the two ruling parties will carefully discuss this issue and er, continue the discussion. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Another bit of news is that if you go to Japan, there is a new regulation. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Japan plans to require the majority of the tourists, visitors visiting Japan, to have their fingerprints and pictures taken. </seg>
<seg id="10"> This is to prevent dangerous figures from entering Japan and to avoid illegal immigrants. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Er, therefore, it should be more inconvenient to go to Japan now. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Well, of course, there is good news in Japan recently. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Kiko, the wife of Japan's second prince, is pregnant. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The pregnancy has led to the hope of many Japanese that she will give birth to a son to inherit the throne. </seg>
<seg id="15"> However, she has also stirred up some waves in the imperial family, which has been relatively quiet. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Er, in fact, Kiko is definitely an older pregnant woman. Moreover, people had always believed that she was happy with a four-person household. </seg>
<seg id="17"> For her to get pregnant again at such an age, many people cannot help but to speculate that, er, a fight for the throne between the two brothers may be unfolding in the imperial family. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Of course, many people take delight in talking about this conspiracy theory. </seg>
<seg id="19"> They claim that this incident may be traced back to a few years ago. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Er, this is how it goes. It was in 2002 when the wife of the eldest Prince Naruhito was diagnosed with depression. As a result, the imperial family did not invest too much hope in them, and pressured the second eldest Prince Akishino in turn. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Akishino did not have too much of a response at the time. </seg>
<seg id="22"> However, in 2004, the conflict was intensified because Naruhito, er, was eager to protect his wife and um, criticized the imperial family in public. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Well, allegedly, the imperial family was furious at that time and requested the second-eldest Prince Akishino, who is of the same generation as Naruhito, to come forward to refute his brother, saying that his doting on his wife was a disrespect to the imperial family. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Since then, the brothers have been at odds. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Now, if the second-eldest Prince Akishino has a boy, well, then their spindle will become a pillar of the imperial family, </seg>
<seg id="26"> while the crown prince, who is also the eldest prince, will thus decline for sure. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Er, therefore, many people say that it will have a great impact on the imperial family and Japanese society. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Annan, the UN Secretary-General, met with US President Bush on Monday at the White House. </seg>
<seg id="2"> In regard to Iran's announcement of postponing its nuclear negotiations with Russia, Annan urged Iran to stop its nuclear activities as soon as possible and to resolve the issue through negotiations and not resistance. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Moreover, there is news that the US Department of Defense has begun to work closely on the plan to bomb Iran as a last resort if diplomatic efforts fail. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Initially, the outside believed that Bush and Annan would discuss the possibility of the UN Security Council imposing sanctions on Iran, but the two did not make public the discussions in this area after the meeting. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Both Bush and Annan reiterated that they hoped to resolve Iran's nuclear issue through talks. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Annan expressed his worries over Iran's launching of enriched uranium activities and its decision to postpone the nuclear talks with Russia. </seg>
<seg id="7"> On the same day, the US media reported that military strategists at the Pentagon have begun to work closely on the plan to take military actions against Iran in case diplomatic efforts fail and the United States uses military means to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="8"> According to the report, commanders at the US Central Command have started ascertaining the targets of attack. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The attack may be by means of the launch of ballistic missiles from submarines and air raids from B2 bombers. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Annan appealed Monday for all parties to refrain from taking actions that will escalate the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Military specialists analyzed that Iran may be capable of producing nuclear weapons in two years. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Bush has more than two years remaining in his second term. </seg>
<seg id="13"> He will strive to resolve Iran's nuclear issue during his term of office, whether it is through peaceful or military means. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Mou Naiqian, Phoenix TV, Washington. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Iranian President Ahmadinejad stated on the 13th that superpowers that use their own weapons to threaten other nations will soon disappear. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Ahmadinejad met with diplomatic envoys from other countries in Tehran at the commemoration of the 27th Anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution. </seg>
<seg id="17"> He indicated that the arms race and the fight for supremacy among nations will not produce any result. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The superpowers' appetite will never be satisfied. They even use weapons to threaten other nations. </seg>
<seg id="19"> However, he claimed that superpowers that rely on weapons to threaten other nations will soon disappear. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The day when mankind can enjoy eternal peace and stability will soon arrive. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Thus, we can see that it is not only a fight of words; in fact, the increasingly explosive situation between Iran and the Western world, with the United States, is becoming more intense. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Due to the mutually unyielding positions between Iran and the United States, some recent changes have appeared in which Iran officially announced the resumption of its enriched uranium refining program two days ago. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In fact, some Western diplomats have speculated that Iran might have actually resumed some enriched uranium refining procedures before that. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In addition, Iran announced that it will postpone the talks with Russia indefinitely, the negotiations on Russia refining enriched uranium for Iran. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Well, of course, the indefinite postponement of the negotiation plan is decided under the new development of the situation. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Recently, due to the continuous threat of the United States to attack Iran, a British think-tank - the Oxford Research Institute - has issued such a report. </seg>
<seg id="27"> If the United States resorts to force, half the people will die. Moreover, it will definitely touch off um, continue the wave of violence in the Middle East this year. </seg>
<seg id="28"> In addition, some terrorist attacks will be intensified. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Of course, oil prices will skyrocket; which is also among the series of domino effects. </seg>
<seg id="30"> The report also stated that if the United States fails to force Iran into compliance, it will definitely accelerate Iran's determination to produce nuclear weapons by itself. </seg>
<seg id="31"> We just mentioned the Russia-Iran negotiation issue. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The Iranian official spokesman indeed stated on Monday that due to the emergence of the new situation, it will postpone the negotiations with Russian officials on the refining of enriched uranium in Russia originally scheduled for the 16th. </seg>
<seg id="33"> A spokesman for Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that it had not received any formal notification from the Iranian authorities. </seg>
<seg id="34"> It is still too early to tell if the meeting will continue. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Moreover, Yusufov, Minister of Atomic Energy for the Russian Federation and Minister of Energy for Russia, stated on Monday that Russia is prepared for talks with Iran to discuss the conditions and principles of the nuclear issue. </seg>

<seg id="3"> The editorial specifically mentioned that Japan's Foreign Minister Taro Aso had made a string of appalling remarks recently. </seg>
<seg id="4"> These statements were all very dishonest and unwise. Moreover, they had provoked a general rage in Asian countries. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The editorial particularly mentioned that Japan should acknowledge and learn from its own mistakes, instead of avoiding to mention what it did during the Second World War in its teaching materials after the war, as it is currently doing. </seg>

Moreover, it was obvious that he lacks knowledge of history and has poor diplomatic sense. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The New York Times was the third-largest circulated newspaper in the United States last year, so it should be very influential in US society. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Thus, this editorial should create a huge impact. </seg>

<seg id="13"> Er, once a military clash breaks out, the United States will be dragged into the mire because it will definitely be drawn into it. </seg>
<seg id="14"> A spokesman for Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who participated in the symposium, said that the Sino-Japanese relation is currently at a very tense stage. </seg>

<seg id="22"> The Georgian police officers on duty expelled the Russian drivers, and the escort personnel then drove the two military vehicles away by force. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The incident had infuriated the Russian peacekeeping troops. </seg>
<seg id="24"> A spokesman for the Russian peacekeeping troops said that the Georgian police used a traffic accident as an excuse to detain a Russian military vehicle on February 1, and has not returned it so far. </seg>
<seg id="25"> On February 8, they held three Russian officers in custody for two days and two nights on the pretext of a visa issue. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The ruthless provocations of Georgia is in hopes that it will create bloodshed in this area and force the Russian troops to open fire, so that it can achieve the aim of making the peacekeeping troops withdraw from South Ossetia. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The Russian embassy in Georgia lodged serious statements with Georgia on that day, demanding that Georgia stop its desperate provocations immediately. Otherwise, Russia will not bear the responsibilities of any clashes resulting from it. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The media indicated that on February 13, Okruashvili, Georgia's Minister of Defense, announced that leaders at the Russian military base in Akhalkalaki had sold several 'STRELA-type' missiles for use with self-propelled anti-aircraft missile systems to South Ossetia. </seg>

<seg id="30"> Experts believe that once the final decision is made, it may lead to the final fundamental breakdown of the Georgian-Russian relationship. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Earlier, Georgian Foreign Minister Bezhuashvili fiercely criticized Russia's position, refuting Russian President Putin's statement that if the West recognizes Kosovo, then Russia may recognize Abkhazia and South Ossetia, arguing that Russia is sending encouraging signals to all the separatist regions. </seg>

Thus, some defense experts argued that it is a sign that the Pentagon cannot fathom China's intentions in expanding its military power, and hopes to learn about the real situation and feel each other out through a joint military exercise. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Moreover, since the defense evaluation report released by the Pentagon at the beginning of the month had considered China as the biggest potential threat in the future, thus, two defense experts also pointed out that the Asian-Pacific military exercise will be the first step for the U.S. Department of Defense to adjust its strategy on this basis. </seg>

<seg id="58"> The attack was believed to have been launched by local separatists and tribal insurgents. </seg>
<seg id="59"> On October 9 of the same year, two Chinese engineers were kidnapped by insurgents in the South Waziristan district at the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. </seg>
<seg id="60"> An engineer was unfortunately shot to death when the Pakistani troops later rescued the hostages. </seg>
<seg id="61"> However, the kidnapping was believed to have been orchestrated by a militant group linked to al-Qaeda, and not by separatist insurgents. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Due to the frequent economic contacts between China and Pakistan, many Chinese engineers take part in Pakistani infrastructure projects and work in the local areas. </seg>
<seg id="63"> Tribal insurgents in Pakistan also accuse the government of seizing their natural resources. </seg>
<seg id="64"> As a result, Chinese have fallen victim to several attacks and kidnaps. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Let's look at a few Japanese news items. </seg>
<seg id="2"> There is a rather shocking piece of news in Japanese politics recently. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Tsuneo Watanabe, President of The Yomiuri Shimbun, a leading outlet in Japan's media, instructed The Yomiuri Shimbun to publish um, articles criticizing Koizumi's visit to the Yasukuni Shrine. Since then, The Yomiuri Shimbun has held the same position on the matter. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Er, well, um, Tsuneo Watanabe railed against Koizumi in um, his speech a few days ago, calling him very ignorant, and that he does not know any history or culture. </seg>
<seg id="5"> He also equated the visitation of the Yasukuni Shrine to the glorification of Hitler. He added that such an act by Koizumi has made China and Korea consider Japan as an extremely dangerous nation, which will cause endless trouble. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Why would Tsuneo Watanabe's position create huge shock waves? </seg>
<seg id="7"> In fact, he is very influential in politics and has always been a hidden hand. </seg>
<seg id="8"> He had been a far rightist in the past. </seg>
<seg id="9"> He had supported the hawks and aggressively promoted the revision of the Constitution. </seg>
<seg id="10"> However, it is a um, huge turn now. </seg>
<seg id="11"> He has turned the cannon around to start bombing Koizumi and opposing such a position. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Actually, in 2004 when people criticized Koizumi for visiting the Yasukuni Shrine, um, Tsuneo Watanabe still claimed that, he claimed that he supported Koizumi, and asked him to stand up to the pressure. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Nonetheless, he made a speech recently saying, "I'll be 80 years old this year. I have very little time left." </seg>
<seg id="14"> Well, now he comes forward and makes anti-war speeches in a lofty tone. </seg>
<seg id="15"> His change in um, allegiance no doubt creates a huge impact on Japanese, um society. </seg>
<seg id="16"> As Tsuneo Watanabe put it himself, "I believe I have the confidence and the ability to change the political situation." </seg>
<seg id="17"> He added that if the government exerts pressure on the freedom of speech and assembly and the editorial freedom of The Yomiuri Shimbun, he would risk his life to resist. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Then, what kind of situation has been formed now? </seg>
<seg id="19"> Japan's largest newspaper, The Yomiuri Shimbun, and its second largest newspaper, um, the %pw Asahi Shimbun, the two major newspapers have joined hands in opposing Koizumi's visit to the Yasukuni Shrine. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Originally, the two major newspapers were two opposing groups. However, after the two presidents met, at least they had reached a consensus on this matter. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Thus, they both adopt strong offensives in um, railing against Koizumi. It can be said that they have formed a dream team. </seg>
<seg id="22"> In fact, these two major newspapers have huge, um, influence on the mainstream public opinion in Japan. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Moreover, let us look at the meeting of the um, House of Representatives in Japan. In a recent meeting, the same remark was made by the top two successor candidates um, of um, Japan's Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Who were these two people? </seg>
<seg id="25"> %pw one was Shinzo Abe, Chief Cabinet Secretary, and the other was Taro Aso, Japan's Foreign Minister, who has repeatedly made um, shocking remarks in recent days. </seg>
<seg id="26"> What remark did both of them make? </seg>
<seg id="27"> They both said that Japan's war criminals of the Second World War were not criminals. </seg>
<seg id="28"> What they meant was that er, it was the international court that called them um, criminals and convicted them. </seg>
<seg id="29"> While in Japan, according to international laws, according to Japanese laws, er, the war criminals had not broken any Japanese laws. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Thus, they argued that war criminals of the Second World War should not be considered as criminals in Japan. </seg>
<seg id="31"> In the meantime, um, Shinzo Abe mentioned that Japan should now have the whole world in view and develop its relationship with the United States and business and trading ties with um, East Asian countries. Moreover, it should develop close ties with India instead of focusing on China all the time. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Championship Hopeful but Not a Sure Thing </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> Loving Life and Luneng </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> The gunpowder smoke of the Chinese Super Cup Soccer Game will soon bring flames of war. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The Luneng Team of Taishan is ready for the new game season, and is preparing to rush to the championship again. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The battles for seizing dominance among Lian, Lu, and Hu, the three strong teams, will break out at any moment. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Who will win the championship at last? </seg>
<seg id="7"> Based on an analysis of actual strengths, although the Taishan Team has a great hope of seizing the championship, it has no full certainty of success. </seg>
<seg id="8"> First, the time for new team members to adapt to each other is short. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The Taishan Team had nothing new last year. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The Taishan Team introduced Li Leilei and Wang Liang, the two members from the national team, this year. Soon after that, it will also add two members to the team from foreign teams, and its actual strength should be seen as increased, not reduced. </seg>
<seg id="11"> But because the national team is preparing for the matches with the Palestinian and Iraqi teams, those members of the national team cannot coordinate with the members of this team. </seg>
<seg id="12"> When they return to the football club, the league matches will start right away, </seg>
<seg id="13"> So, the issue of adapting to each other is the biggest issue the Taishan Team is facing. </seg>
<seg id="14"> I think that those members from the national team can be substitute players for the first several rounds of games in the league matches. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Firstly, they can be trained to adapt to the team in matches; </seg>
<seg id="16"> secondly, those national team members who have played two group matches can have a rest. </seg>
<seg id="17"> After several rounds of matches, their edge would be honed, and it won't be too late for them to participate. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Second, its defense has hidden problems. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The defense of the Taishan Team was scolded as a sick one by its fans last year. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Li Leilei was introduced this year, and has improved the defense, but the team has not reached the time for sitting back and relaxing. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The problem of center halfbacks' and fullbacks' slowness in turning back still exists, and those substitute players are either older in age or lack experience. </seg>
<seg id="22"> If center halfbacks and fullbacks can solidly play their roles, the Taishan Team would have one more advantage in its path to seizing the championship. </seg>
<seg id="23"> I think that it does not hurt to use Ren Yongshun who has good physical qualities, although lacking experience. He can exercise this year in preparation for the future. </seg>
<seg id="24"> And also, it is OK to withdraw Gao Rao to play fullback. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Many members of the Taishan Team can play fullback, including Cui Peng and Hai Bin. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Gao Rao is strong physically, and can aggressively and fiercely intercept the ball, and should be able to do a good job in the position of either center halfback or fullback. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Third, whether foreign players can adapt to the team. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The introduction of foreign players is a big issue that has been puzzling the Taishan Team. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Nobody dares to say anything good about Dan Qiu's performance last year. </seg>
<seg id="30"> It is known that foreign players have not been selected for introduction for this year. </seg>
<seg id="31"> I think that in addition to introduction of an outstanding forward, a very good left-foot forward should be introduced too. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Except Xing Rui, who played on the Taishan Team several years ago, there has not been a real left-foot player on the team. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Although some players like Cui Peng can play the role, a real left-foot forward would be much better than one who is a guest player. </seg>
<seg id="34"> If these three issues can be solved well, the path for the Taishan Team to seize the championship should be somewhat smoother. </seg>
<seg id="35"> As a Shandong football fan, I really hope that the Taishan Team will be able to seize the championship this year. </seg>
<seg id="36"> But frankly speaking, the Taishan Team is very hopeful, but has no full guarantee of winning the championship this year. </seg>

</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> BrandVista Post: </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> How is everyone? </seg>
<seg id="4"> The Spring Festival has passed us again like this, and friends who combined vacations with the Spring Festival holidays have gradually returned to their posts. </seg>
<seg id="5"> We wish all friends a happy new year, if it is not too late to say Happy New Year now. </seg>
<seg id="6"> On that day I chatted with NPLCN in a cafe; he mentioned that the present Geometry Brand </seg>
<seg id="7"> Website looks much prettier. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Good from contents to formats. </seg>
<seg id="9"> His most favorite is the recent thoroughly innovated BBS that is based on Discuz Community. </seg>
<seg id="10"> As for the community, I have to thank someone. </seg>
<seg id="11"> He is Mr. Li Mingshun, the General Manager of Discuz Beijing Corporation. </seg>
<seg id="12"> A heap of results can be found if you search his name on Google. </seg>
<seg id="13"> You probably know that he was at Sina.com, and later he himself created a business, and established an Internet advertisement exchange platform for small and medium-size enterprises, similar to adbrite.com abroad. </seg>
<seg id="14"> He debated on MSN at that time. His rough idea is that: Geometry feels that the development of many of China's industries depends on the strength of private economy and small and medium-size enterprises. </seg>
<seg id="15"> But in China's present market, this situation cannot make people optimistic. </seg>
<seg id="16"> So, intellectual trades, similar services, and consultation of small and medium-size enterprises cannot form sizable ones. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Collection of higher fees for their own development will eventually bring a pessimistic cycle. </seg>
<seg id="18"> He later went to Discuz. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Discuz is an excellent community program based on PHP and MySQL databases. </seg>
<seg id="20"> With the help of Ramboo, a technical engineer from Beijing, Geometry Brand's community is finally seeing the light again, and is stepping on stage with a very fresh face. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The feedback is very good. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The interface is clean and friendly. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Speed is quite quick. </seg>
<seg id="24"> I'm starting to feel a kind of joy at writing words that make myself aware of something and inspire others, and communicate with friends who pursue the same thing in the same trade about small things in our work and life in a very clean interface. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Thanks Discuz! </seg>
<seg id="26"> There is a lot of news in the advertisement field. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The system on opening advertisement trade regulated by the WTO is starting to be implemented from the beginning of January. </seg>
<seg id="28"> All of the big Laowai (old foreigners) have arrived on the site, one after another, and small Laowai are sharpening their knives noisily. It seems to be prosperous everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Baidi Advertising out of Singapore has many troubles. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Sir Martin is finally finding a little time away from the lawsuit in Italy to consider shuffling the deck after losing some heavyweight customers and continuous development setbacks on the Mainland. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Baidi Advertising and Batey will be incorporated into JWT network and maintain their brands, and will be managed by JWT. </seg>
<seg id="32"> And at the same time, some rumors say that Bates and 141 networks will be incorporated into the Aomei system, and will be managed by Aomei Advertising Network. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Although 141 has been returned to Aomei before, it is still an interesting thing to let Da Pisi return to Aomei. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Websites have updated many articles during the Spring Festival. We don't need to mention every one of them here. </seg>
<seg id="35"> If everybody has time, he or she can check Websites. </seg>
<seg id="36"> At the same time, friends who have not participated in the new forum can click the mouse one more time without any trouble, and enter into the totally new Geometry Brand community. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Feel the environment, experience the atmosphere, and contribute your words. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Hope you'll be happy for finding the organization. </seg>
<seg id="39"> We wish every friend a beautiful mood. </seg>

<seg id="3"> Read this article, and wanted to share it with people. </seg>
<seg id="4"> This is not an impulsion, but warmness and kindness staying in my heart for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="5"> I ask myself if it were me, what I would do. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The answer is very clear. I would hang up the phone, "You dialed a wrong number." </seg>
<seg id="7"> This year I have been thinking about what really counts for helping people. </seg>
<seg id="8"> I have given up tentative conduct, such as donations of cash or items. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Some friend said a couple of days ago that he has no time to take care of himself, not mention to help people, even though his desire for providing help is bigger than his ability. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Wish you a happy day :) </seg>
<seg id="11"> Helen </seg>
<seg id="12"> Mom of Ten Years Ago </seg>
<seg id="13"> It was one day ten years ago when this teacher was taking a nap by using the rest time at noon. Suddenly, the phone rang. </seg>
<seg id="14"> She picked up the phone, and heard a strange and rude voice: "Your child stole a book, and we caught her. Come and hurry up!" </seg>
<seg id="15"> The crying noise of a little girl and denouncing voices from others came out of the handset. </seg>
<seg id="16"> She understood the thing immediately when she turned her head and looked at her only daughter, who was watching TV. </seg>
<seg id="17"> There must be a little girl who was caught by the saleswoman for stealing a book. She does not want her family members to know this, so she made up a phone number, and a phone call happens to come here. </seg>
<seg id="18"> She could of course hang up the phone and give no response, and even scold the other side. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Because this thing has nothing to do with her. </seg>
<seg id="20"> But she herself is a teacher; maybe that girl is one of her pupils. </seg>
<seg id="21"> She could probably imagine through the phone that that little girl, who made a wrong decision at that moment, must be very panicked, and may be facing the most terrible situation of her life. </seg>
<seg id="22"> After she hesitated for a moment, she suddenly had an idea in her mind. Yes, I will do it this way. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Then, she asked for the detailed address of the bookstore, and hurried there. </seg>
<seg id="24"> As she expected, a little girl with tear stains all over her face was standing in the bookstore. </seg>
<seg id="25"> And those adults standing around were scolding her ferociously in loud voices. </seg>
<seg id="26"> She rushed to the poor little girl and held her in her arms, and turned her head to the sales clerks around, and said: "Talk to me if you have something to say. Do not terrify the child." </seg>
<seg id="27"> She took the little girl with her and walked out of the bookstore after she paid out several dozen Yuan as a fine, while the sales clerks were whispering reluctantly. Then, she could clearly see the face messed with tears and panic. </seg>
<seg id="28"> She smiled, and brought the little girl home. She cleaned her up thoroughly and let her go without asking anything. </seg>
<seg id="29"> She especially urged her before she left, "If you want to read books, you could come here, auntie's home has a lot of books." </seg>
<seg id="30"> The little girl, who was still in a panic, gazed at her deeply before running away, and never showed up again. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Time passes as quickly as running water, and a period of ten years has passed in a flash without notice. </seg>
<seg id="32"> She had forgotten the thing a long time ago, and still lives there with a calm and serene life. </seg>
<seg id="33"> One afternoon, knocking noises came from outside the door. </seg>
<seg id="34"> A young and strange girl with a pretty face appeared when she opened the door. She had a big smile on her face and was holding a big pile of gifts in her hands. </seg>
<seg id="35"> "Who are you looking for?" </seg>
<seg id="36"> She asked with doubt. </seg>
<seg id="37"> The girl was moved and talked with a lot of words. </seg>
<seg id="38"> It was not easy for her to find out from the strange girl's talking that she was the little girl of that year. Ten years after, she had graduated from a university without any difficulties, and now she had made a special trip to see her. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The young girl said with a soft voice and tears in her eyes: "Although I still don't understand why you were willing to pretend to be my mom and save me, during these 10 years, I have always felt that I want to call you mom." </seg>
<seg id="40"> The teacher's eyes also started to become blurred. </seg>
<seg id="41"> "If I did not help you that day, what was going to happen to you?" She asked with curiosity. </seg>
<seg id="42"> The face of the girl suddenly became gloomy. She shook her head slightly and said, "I cannot explain it clearly, I might have done a stupid thing or even killed myself." </seg>
<seg id="43"> The teacher felt a sudden jump in her heart, and began to rejoice in her mind. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The decision she made at that moment in that year could even impact a person in her life. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Looking at the happy smile on the face of that girl, she also smiled with her. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Military Situation Observation: How Long can Iran Hold Up under Air Attacks by US Armed Forces? </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> Yun Feiquan </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> If traditional warfare of attrition is described as letting an opponent bleed to death, then modern warfare is shooting at the head of an opponent first and making him a "human vegetable" before he bleeds. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The gap between the military capabilities of Iran and the United States is not their quantities, but understanding of modern warfare. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Iran, which came to a draw with Iraq in an eight-year war, does not seem to understand the real meaning of modern high-tech warfare. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The British International Intelligence Comments pointed out a few days ago, after it analyzed the state of US armed forces movements, that the US armed forces are preparing to launch large-scale air attacks on Iran... </seg>
<seg id="7"> The current status of the Iranian air force is worrisome. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The present status of the Iranian air forces is quite similar with that of the Iraqi air force before the Iraq War in 2003. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Iran itself does not have the capacity to independently develop modern weapons, and is embargoed from importing weapons from the West. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Once a war breaks out, it is really a question of whether those old and obsolete aircrafts of the Iranian air force could take off to confront the US armed forces. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Currently, the Iranian air defense system is mainly composed of the air force and ground air defense troops of the Iranian regular armed forces, and the air-defense forces of the Revolutionary Guard Corps. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Among them, the Iranian air forces have around 50,000 troops, and more than 300 various types of combat aircrafts. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Their primary aircraft models include the F-4 "Phantom," F-5 "Tiger," and F-14 "Tomcat" made by the US and the MIG-29 made by Russia, etc. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The ground air defense troops are mainly equipped with surface to air missiles, including the US "Hawk," British "Javelin" and some of the Russian "SAM" series of missiles. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Harold Hutchinson, a US military expert, and Helamuchisin, a military expert from Russia's Politics and Military Analysis Institute, analyzed the current status of the Iranian air defense forces, and think that the Iranian air defense capacities and air defense system and construction still have some loopholes in the current status. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Hutchinson thinks that the Iranian air forces are not at all at the same level with the US armed forces from the perspective of whole actual strength. </seg>
<seg id="17"> A lot of the Iranian combat aircrafts made by the US cannot be used because of lack of parts, upgrades, and maintenance. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The F-14 fighter planes previously regarded as the elite ones in the Iranian air force only have about ten capable of taking off from the ground. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The combat reliability of AIM 54 "Phoenix" missiles, claimed to be capable of over-the-horizon attacks, is also doubtful. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Helamuchisin pointed out that those Iranian air defense missile systems provided by the US from the 1970s to the 1980s of the last century have lost their combat powers because of lack of spare parts. </seg>
<seg id="21"> And other air defense weapons that do not form any systems, such as weapons obtained from Russia and other countries, have no capabilities at all to cope with the US armed forces, which have powerful electromagnetic combat capabilities. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Scrappy weapons affect combat power </seg>
<seg id="23"> Apparently, the Iranian government realizes that its fate in a war depends on whether it is capable of defending the sky over its head, and is starting to prepare only at the last moment, scrape weapons together, and strengthen its air defense system. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Its methods can be summed up as the two strategies from the current state: </seg>
<seg id="25"> The first one is to conceal important nuclear facilities as much as possible and strengthen their anti-strike capabilities. </seg>
<seg id="26"> According to a report from the British newspaper Times, Iran has hidden core parts of its nuclear facilities 18 meters under ground and added a protection shell of 2-meter-thick cement, including the nuclear plant in Natanz and the uranium enrichment center in Isfahan. </seg>
<seg id="27"> But the US armed forces have taken a strategy in advance. They saw the effects of underground bunkers in anti-air attack combat as early as during the Gulf War in 1991, and have rushed developing various ground-penetrating bombs. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Through more than 10 years' studies on targets, the US armed forces have had a whole set of combat methods and weapons coping with underground consolidated bunkers. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Iran has also purchased a lot of advanced air defense weapons from Russia in recent years. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Since the end of last year, the Iranian government has reached agreements with Russia, one after another, for the purchase of the Pechora-2A air defense missile system and 29 sets of "Dower" air defense missile systems, worth 700 million US dollars. </seg>
<seg id="31"> However, a modern war is a rivalry between systems. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Various US armed forces air-attack weapons are developed by the US itself, and they have been sharpened and become a set of war machines with outstanding effects after years of tests in actual warfare. </seg>
<seg id="33"> And those "new weapons" scraped together by Iran from other countries are still a question of whether they can form combat power in a short time. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Weapons are not Iran's only gap. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Combat Outlines, published by the US armed forces in 1982, first came up with the idea of "integrated air-ground warfare," and stressed the use of air supremacy to strike high-value targets in an enemy's strategic depth area, paralyzing the enemy's command system at the beginning of a war, and making him as "meat on the cutting board" even though he has very powerful conventional forces. </seg>
<seg id="36"> In the Gulf War in 1991, Kosovo War in 1999, and the Iraq War in 2003, what the US armed forces paid attention to was not how many aircrafts the opponents had, but the firing range of their own "Tomahawk" cruise missile. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Although the Iranian government has prepared for possible air attacks and started to take measures to strengthen air defense capabilities, Iran, which came to a draw with Iraq in an eight-year war, does not seem to understand the real meaning of modern high-tech warfare. </seg>
<seg id="38"> With the development of US armed forces military transition work in recent years, the air-attack activities of the US armed forces are totally different from the carpet bombing method in the Vietnam War era, and rely on various new high-tech weapons and high-precision and whole-depth air strikes that are based on modern information technology. </seg>
<seg id="39"> How long the Iranian ground air defense system can sustain itself in this kind of air strikes is still an unknown element. </seg>

<seg id="4"> This move might pose a serious threat to the dominant status of Microsoft Corp., MSFT, in the PC software market. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Jess Blackburn, the news spokesman for Dell Corporation, said that the corporation is assessing Google's software. </seg>
<seg id="6"> After the software is installed, PC users can use the software to search not only on the Internet, but also for information stored on their PCs. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Blackburn confirmed that the software the corporation is testing includes the Dell homepage supported by Google, Google's desktop search system and Google's toolbar. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Google's news spokesman, Jon Murchinson, also confirmed at the same time that his company is testing a batch of software, developed by Google, with Dell. </seg>
<seg id="9"> As the Wall Street Journal previously reported, Google - the IT new baron - is negotiating with Dell and Hewlett-Packard Co., and is trying to persuade these computer manufacturing giants to install Google's software for their computers. </seg>
<seg id="10"> According to an internal source cited by the Wall Street Journal, to achieve the goal, Google might pay 1 billion dollars to Dell in the coming three years. </seg>
<seg id="11"> However, neither company has disclosed related details. </seg>
<seg id="12"> And also, the Hewlett-Packard side has refused to make a comment on it. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The Microsoft Corporation news spokesman, Neil Charney, refused to make a comment on the news mentioned above. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Microsoft is currently planning to promote its next-generation search tool for the Windows operating system and strengthen development of its online business. </seg>
<seg id="15"> On the day the news was released, Google's stock price fell another 4.46%, dropping to 367.92 dollars. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The Microsoft's stock price fell 1%, and closed at 26.94 dollars on that day. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Some analysts pointed out that Google is anxious to seek another direction of expansion in addition to network searches, and that its integration with Dell and other PC giants might prompt Google to threaten Microsoft's core business. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Matt Rosoff, an analyst on Microsoft's direction at a market investigation and research company, said that Microsoft is absolutely concerned and worried that Google is eager to expand its new income sources. </seg>
<seg id="19"> But some analysts do not think so. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Charles Di Bona, an analyst at market analysis company Sanford C. Bernstein, pointed out that it is too early for Google to shake Microsoft's dominant status. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Reporter's Journal: Google Shakes Microsoft's Domination? </seg>
<seg id="22"> Hui Zhengyi </seg>
<seg id="23"> There is no doubt that computers have become necessities in the life and work of modern people. </seg>
<seg id="24"> However, there is only a minority of people who understand the working rationale of computers, when everyone can skillfully operate them. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Like they use "dummy" cameras, most "newbies" can play the black boxes well as long as those boxes have friendly interfaces, and convenient and simple software. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Thus, original software installed on a PC manufacturer's products can usually determine most consumers' using habits. </seg>
<seg id="27"> It is through this measure that Microsoft has tightly controlled the PC operating system market. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Right now, Google, a new rival of Microsoft, tends to share part of the market through the same measure. </seg>
<seg id="29"> A well-known economics medium in Taiwan recently made a very interesting metaphor. </seg>
<seg id="30"> "Computer manufacturers including Dell and Hewlett-Packard are starting to use computers like shelves in a supermarket and are collecting the "stocking fee" from software companies. </seg>
<seg id="31"> A successful bidder can make its own software show up in the 'critical ten minutes' when users turn on their new computers, and guide consumers to use its products. </seg>
<seg id="32"> This kind of fee collection mode is like how a supermarket collects stocking fees from food manufacturers. </seg>
<seg id="33"> This phenomenon demonstrates that Microsoft's control power is beginning to loosen without a doubt. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Managers at Microsoft have warned Bill Gates that the Microsoft's hegemonic status will eventually be threatened if Google starts to pay PC manufacturers for installation of Google's software on their computer products. </seg>
<seg id="35"> No matter what the outcome is, the number one status that Microsoft has been enjoying in those comfortable days may become history. </seg>
<seg id="36"> After all, it is easy to become dominant, but it is difficult to maintain a dominant status. </seg>

<seg id="3"> Just Sword: Prospects for 2006 </seg>
<seg id="4"> Author: Just Sword </seg>
<seg id="5"> I remember that in the beginning of 2005, Apple Journal in Hong Kong published an article titled "Dharma Wheel Spins Constantly and Its Merits Can Overcome an Enemy Country." </seg>
<seg id="6"> The article alleged that 2004 was a year in which Falun Gong advanced rapidly while singing triumphant songs. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The article stated that overseas officials of the Chinese Communist Party acted like buffoons suppressing Falun Gong in various places, and totally lost face when beginning Falun Gong learners told the truths everywhere in the world. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But compared with the marvelous scene showing the great wave of Party membership withdrawal brought by the "Nine Comments" in 2005, 2004 does not seem outstanding. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Then, how will 2006 be? </seg>
<seg id="10"> The two events that occurred at the beginning of this year can probably demonstrate some development track for this year. </seg>
<seg id="11"> One is the article "Elimination of Evil" published by the founder of Falun Gong. This article announced and sentenced that those agents of the Chinese Communist Party will face their coming judgment day after July 20, 1999. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Maybe many people still have doubts about or disbelieve this article. </seg>
<seg id="13"> But no matter whether they believe it or not, the history and facts will prove it! </seg>
<seg id="14"> Of course, those agents of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) are like rats living in dark ditches. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Their "natural or accidental death" will not draw attention from the society and public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="16"> But broad deaths or remorse of CCP agents at home and abroad brought by the Heavens will definitely bring powerful strikes and shake the power strata of the CCP. </seg>
<seg id="17"> They will have to carefully consider their path of retreat and road for life - withdrawal from the Party, desertion or changing their side under the awesome deterrence of the elimination brought by the Heavens. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Thus, the "superbly stable bureaucratic system and group of the CCP" will begin to be shaken, disrupted, and collapse! </seg>
<seg id="19"> The other event is the hunger strike campaign for human rights launched by Gao Zhicheng. </seg>
<seg id="20"> This suddenly arisen campaign, which did not receive a good prediction from some people in the beginning, unexpectedly brought warm reactions from everywhere in the world, and common responses from all strata and various forces. </seg>
<seg id="21"> If this activity can integrate various just forces and suffering masses into a connection and make it real and big, then the outside force that launches the final strike on the CCP, the evil regime that is as fragile as a pile of eggs, will finally be formed from it. </seg>
<seg id="22"> If we say that 2005 was a year when the Communist Party was eliminated from the perspective of the spiritual aspect, then 2006 will be the phase in which the Party will be gotten rid of in both the spiritual and material aspects. </seg>
<seg id="23"> With the further spread of the "Nine Comments" and further development of the wave of Party membership withdrawal, the self-disruption of the CCP, and the cohesion and formation of outside just forces, the life of the CCP monster will formally enter into a countdown state. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The wills of the Heavens and humans have been integrated, and the sacred power and human strength are gathering. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The long sword in the sky is directly pointed at the CCP monster! </seg>
<seg id="26"> If we say that 2004 was a year for advancing rapidly while singing triumphant songs, and 2005 is a marvelous year, then what will be the conclusion of 2006? </seg>
<seg id="27"> I hope it will be a shocking great change, and a victory and triumphant return! </seg>

<seg id="5"> Title: Xu Zhiyong: A Letter to Li Qun, the Secretary of Linyi City Party Committee: Hooliganism will Also Harm Yourself </seg>
<seg id="6"> Website for sending mail: Feeling Like Old Friends at the First Meeting (Wed Feb 8 13:56:14 2006). This website (yjrg.net) </seg>
<seg id="7"> Until yesterday, the government of Linyi, led by you, had illegally placed Chen Guangcheng under house arrest for 165 days. </seg>
<seg id="8"> You collaborated with rogues and the mafia society to put a blind legal citizen in jail illegally for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="9"> You cut off his home's phone line, installed a cell phone jamming device in his yard; </seg>
<seg id="10"> You also beat him and his family members many times. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Your barbarous conduct has gone beyond the bottom line of a civilized society. </seg>
<seg id="12"> You also used means of rogues and the mafia society to beat me and lawyer Li Fangping in the beginning of October, 2005. But we bore this, and we always tried to understand your difficult situation as much as possible, and were even acquiescent for a time of the house arrest of Chen Guangcheng. </seg>
<seg id="13"> However, 165 days have passed. You not only have not controlled your behavior, but you also make it worse. </seg>
<seg id="14"> You sent a big team of policemen and rogues to harass villagers; </seg>
<seg id="15"> You continued to arrest and beat villagers; </seg>
<seg id="16"> What you have done is too outrageous! </seg>
<seg id="17"> Today, I clearly remind you that those means of rogues and the mafia society will harm yourself in turn at the moment when you continue to organize rogues and the mafia society to besiege Chen Guangcheng. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It was worth your examination when this thing started in the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The family planning of Linyi is the first one from the bottom of the provincial list in the whole province. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The anxiety in your mind is understandable as the secretary of the city Party committee. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But it is wrong for you to think that only use of violence and force can implement the state's law and policy because of the low qualities of the people in Linyi. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Whose fault exactly is it that citizens do not coordinate with the conduct of the government? </seg>
<seg id="23"> Is it because of the low qualities of the citizens or much less public trust, since the government has told too many lies and made too many schemes? </seg>
<seg id="24"> If (we) say that the same government's conduct was not that absurd ten years ago, in 2005 China's society has made obvious progress and human rights protection has been written into the Constitution; don't you think that your barbarous conduct is too outrageous? </seg>
<seg id="25"> Why don't you examine that only your Linyi dares to act in this way? </seg>
<seg id="26"> Why is only your Linyi unable to practice law enforcement by using democratic and legal means? </seg>
<seg id="27"> Linyi City should have been able to make a sincere explanation and make the public understand, after a batch of brave citizens including Chen Guangcheng reported about the fact of the barbarous law enforcement, a batch of citizens including Teng Biao - who dared to protect citizen's rights - were involved, and the investigation conclusion was made by the National Family Planning Committee. </seg>
<seg id="28"> After all, family planning is a difficult topic with Chinese characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Everyone can understand your difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="30"> However, you took a further absurd measure - brought Chen Guangcheng back and put him in jail by catching him from Beijing - and also tried to accuse him of illegally providing the state's confidential information. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Don't you think that it is a very absurd accusation for a blind man who lives in a poor mountain village? </seg>
<seg id="32"> In fact, as long as you have truly corrected mistakes, as long as you have done things very well, are you still afraid of the criticism of a blind man? </seg>
<seg id="33"> Is it necessary for you to send several dozens of people to watch him 24 hours a day, and even sentence him in a hurried and desperate way? </seg>
<seg id="34"> I and Lawyer Li Fangping arrived in Dongshigu Village on October 4, 2005. We demonstrated our very clear position and hoped to solve the conflicts. </seg>
<seg id="35"> We made a suggestion that we could talk with your officials to learn your ideas and requests. </seg>
<seg id="36"> We took the initiative and suggested that we could help you to persuade Chen Guangcheng, to influence him not to say some of his words. </seg>
<seg id="37"> We hoped that you would not treat a blind man in this way, and both sides should make some compromises. </seg>
<seg id="38"> However, your decision maker just follow his own way, and moreover, even had "carefully planned" an episode - to beat and put us in jail illegally. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Do you think that your activities can make us scared? </seg>
<seg id="40"> We have not done anything that violates laws. </seg>
<seg id="41"> We are fearless. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Although China's legal system is not perfect, at least it has not become absolutely lawless. </seg>
<seg id="43"> You think that use of means of rogues and the mafia society can scare us away, then you have greatly underestimated our determination and willpower. </seg>
<seg id="44"> As long as we would like to, we have many people who have many legitimate reasons to go to Linyi or go to see Chen Guangcheng. </seg>
<seg id="45"> You can beat lawyers and scholars one, two, and three times, but every time would attract broad attention and reports about it. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Do you really dare to beat us ten times? </seg>
<seg id="47"> Don't you care about your official position very much? </seg>
<seg id="48"> If somebody is beaten and injured, will your position still be in a solid status? </seg>
<seg id="49"> Not listening to our reasonable advice, instead using some indecent means of rogues, don't you think this is very silly and dangerous? </seg>
<seg id="50"> I want to tell you clearly that, in China, there is a big batch of excellent citizens who are loyal to conscience and follow the legal system. </seg>
<seg id="51"> We do not fear rogues and the mafia society. </seg>
<seg id="52"> We cannot stand reckless trampling on the bottom line of human civilization. </seg>
<seg id="53"> If you have done too much beyond boundaries, we will calmly and confidently march forward batch by batch toward your sticks until the moment when you retreat. </seg>
<seg id="54"> You should be clear that use of the means of rogues and the mafia society is not something good for you. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Do not think that you can get rid of any link connected with those local rogues or hooligans who beat villagers as long as you hide backstage. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Finally, I also want to remind you to treat Chen Guangcheng well. </seg>
<seg id="57"> A person who was blind from his childhood, graduated from a college of traditional Chinese medicine, self-studied laws and English, and sued Beijing Subway Company for the interest of the blind, and brought tap water for villagers, and became a well-known "Lawyer Chen" everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="58"> You even mobilized shameful indecent individuals to make rumors about and slander him, and tried to accuse him of illegally sending confidential information across the border. Don't you think that what you did is too outrageous? </seg>
<seg id="59"> It is illegal for you to place Chen Guangcheng under house arrest, and it is also dangerous for you to do this. </seg>
<seg id="60"> You should have been able to release him for sure. </seg>
<seg id="61"> If the conduct of barbarous law enforcement has been stopped, how long could he maintain the criticism if you let him criticize it freely? </seg>
<seg id="62"> But today you are continuously smearing your own image. </seg>
<seg id="63"> You won't be peaceful as long as Chen Guangcheng has not been set for free for a day. </seg>
<seg id="64"> It is enough for you to make him suffer. </seg>
<seg id="65"> We would never stand by and do nothing if you still want to charge him with any crime or use further rogue means. </seg>

</poster>
<seg id="3"> I admit very disappointedly that the Chinese nation does not deserve to have democracy!!! </seg>
<seg id="4"> Aren't those who post their messages here doing this thing now! </seg>
<seg id="5"> The pity is that there are not many people who go online and read it (compared with 1.4 billion). </seg>
<seg id="6"> Those who go online and care and participate in these kinds of topics would be much fewer: I dare to allege that the number would be less than 1% of people online. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Not to mention that this network has the Golden Shield project, which is the biggest, most thorough, advanced, expensive, and quality one. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It is true. </seg>
<seg id="9"> One could feel depressed, hopeless, helpless, and even think of surrendering, but if one wants to live a human life, whom can he depend on except that he himself struggles for it? </seg>
<seg id="10"> Although doing a thing depends on human effort, and success relies on the Heavens, I would think I am wrong if I have not made an effort for my own ideal, even though it is not successful, and I deserve to live like a dog. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Making an effort for a just thing itself can make one's own life somewhat wonderful, and at least in his heart when he evaluates himself. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In fact, I do not need to be concerned about China's future at all, </seg>
<seg id="13"> because the environment in the world is no longer allowing a regime that has not been elected to exist for long. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This is just a matter of time. </seg>
<seg id="15"> What I lament is that the Chinese nation is very lucky to be led on the path to hell by a world-class great man and completely exploited from its bone and blood whenever it is at a historical turning point. Even if somebody calls piles of white bones and areas of blood stains along the path as brilliances, and forces us to be proud of the brilliances. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Everywhere has a dark night, but the longest one is in Shenzhou (the sacred state). </seg>
<seg id="17"> People would suffer a lot when the Qin Emperor integrated with the Confucian Sage. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Qin Shihuang was an open tyranny and the Confucian Sage privately washed brains. </seg>
<seg id="19"> It is not that Chinese people do not deserve to have democracy; it is because they have not had the democratic gene or their gene has been degenerated. </seg>
<seg id="20"> A nation that has been established for more than three thousand years, it might have had democracy a long time ago if its national culture contained democratic elements. </seg>
<seg id="21"> What were Chinese people doing when Athens established a democratic system, Rome set up a republic, the British passed the Constitution, the French published the Declaration of Human Rights, and the Americans issued the Declaration of Independence? </seg>
<seg id="22"> Mongolians had a Kurultai system for selection of their king before they entered into Zhong Yuan; Manchurians in their early time had a Ministers Council of the Prince Regent for democratic consultation. Why were those systems all gone when they entered into the Han region? </seg>
<seg id="23"> Chinese people pursue materials only and have no interest in spiritual faith and political rights. </seg>
<seg id="24"> If you do not believe it, as long as a Chinese person has an election right, he can sell it to you for a meat pancake. </seg>
<seg id="25"> 500,000 years later, if Chinese people want democracy, there must be an earthquake coming. If you can run, please do it! </seg>

<seg id="3"> Dalai Envoy Holding Closed-Door Meeting with Chinese Officials </seg>
<seg id="4"> The Dalai Lama stressed that he hopes that Tibet will have autonomy instead of independence. </seg>
<seg id="5"> An envoy of the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader in exile, is holding a closed-door meeting with Chinese officials in Beijing, and no details have been disclosed publicly. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This is the fifth formal meeting since China and the Dalai government in exile restored their contact in 2002. </seg>
<seg id="7"> But as usual, neither side has disclosed any details when holding the closed-door meeting. </seg>
<seg id="8"> A reporter said that both sides have held many talks, but have not made any substantial achievement so far. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The Dalai Lama, who is in exile in North India, said that he hopes that Tibet will have autonomy instead of independence. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The Chinese side refused to make any comment on the bilateral talks. </seg>
<seg id="11"> But as analysts said, the reason why Beijing hoped to have the bilateral talks is partially because it is worried that if the spiritual leader in exile dies, it might make Tibetans unhappier about China's rule. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Cultural identification </seg>
<seg id="13"> The Dalai government in exile delegation is led by Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari, who was the chief delegate for several previous talks. </seg>
<seg id="14"> A spokesman for the Tibetan government in exile said that several talks held in Switzerland between them and Chinese officials in 2005 were very "close and frank," which brings hope to Tibetans. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The spokesman said that they hope to eventually solve related issues with the Chinese leadership based on the foundation established by negotiations, and let the Tibetans have freedom, and maintain the cultural identification that they think is the most important thing. </seg>

<seg id="17"> Dalai Lama Envoy Reiterated not to Seek Tibetan Independence. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The Dalai Lama will visit Washington DC this month. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Before the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader, visits the United States on November 8, his envoy said that the Tibetan government in exile does not request Tibetan independence. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari said in Washington that he hopes that the Chinese government will ensure protection of the unique Tibetan culture and tradition. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It is expected that when the Dalai Lama visits the United States next week, he will discuss Tibetan issues with President Bush, and hope that Bush could urge the Chinese government to give Tibet real autonomy. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Delegates of the Dalai and officials from Beijing had direct contact for the first time in Bern in July of this year. </seg>
<seg id="23"> "A Real Autonomy" </seg>
<seg id="24"> Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari pointed out that both the Tibetan government in exile and Chinese authorities have seen some positive aspects from their talks in recent years. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The Dalai Lama's envoy discovered that leaders from Beijing, especially those delegates of the Central United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, are more willing to listen to their views than they did before. </seg>
<seg id="26"> However, Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari said that there are too many differences between the Tibetan government in exile and the Chinese government, and there is a big gap between the positions of both sides. </seg>
<seg id="27"> He said that in the past five years, the Tibetan government in exile has done its best to create a good environment for negotiation requested by China, </seg>
<seg id="28"> and China should also create a good environment for negotiation of the Tibetan issue, and should not suppress the Dalai Lama all the time. </seg>
<seg id="29"> He said that the Dalai Lama does not request Tibetan independence, and Tibet is still a part of China, but the Chinese government must maintain the unique culture of Tibet and "let Tibetans have a real autonomy." </seg>
<seg id="30"> Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari also pointed out that some Chinese think that as soon as the Dalai Lama passes away, the Tibetan issue will disappear. </seg>
<seg id="31"> He said that this view is very dangerous, because once the Dalai Lama is gone, China would lose the historical opportunity to solve the Tibetan issue. </seg>
<seg id="32"> He said that as long as the Chinese government responds to the request raised by the Dalai Lama, and comes up with a final solution, the Dalai Lama would not need to talk about the Tibetan issue internationally any more. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Negotiation and Compromise are the Important Means of Democracy! (ZT) </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> Houze </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> I just now saw a poster on "Great Decency -To Old Mr. Guiren" sent by a network friend. </seg>
<seg id="4"> His (her) original words are that "Negotiation and compromise are the important means of democracy. Otherwise, a split because of different views is a failure of democracy!!! Hope that those ideal democrats pay fully attention to this!" </seg>
<seg id="5"> This plain and tasteless sentence, which has not attracted interest from any network friends, has made me imagine a lot and have many sorts of feelings. </seg>
<seg id="6"> At that moment I thought of the ancient times of China and the past of the West. </seg>
<seg id="7"> I seldom sent the main poster. I cannot help but reply to the poster of the network friend in the way of the main poster. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Let's see China's ancient times. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Everyone knows that since Qin Shihuang established the universally unified and centralized power system in China, any subsequent dynasties were operated under the political framework. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Although the Han Dynasty temporarily implemented a "two-track system," i.e. a political system that practiced the feudal system and centralized power system at the same time, it eventually switched to a complete centralized power system in the end. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The outcome of this kind of centralized power system had an advanced aspect in the historical condition by then, which promoted the development of productivity. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But we should also see that the long-term operation of the system for more than 2,000 years had made local administrations lacking of their creativities, initiatives, and enthusiasms, and unable to make various suitable systems and policies for local developments based on local circumstances. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The pyramid type of ruling system had made lower-class officials looking upward only and following directions from their superiors for everything. </seg>
<seg id="14"> There was no room for coordination and negotiation because even local officials at the county level were appointed by the central government, not to mention those common people. </seg>
<seg id="15"> When rights of farmers were infringed upon in ancient China, they could only bear it time and again. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Only when their basest rights were threatened, i.e. when a famine spread in big areas, a tyrannical rule or natural disaster caused loss of their living rights, would they rebel. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In more than 2,000 years, many peasant uprisings spread everywhere in the country like storms, but they never won a victory in a real sense except Zhu Yuanzhang, from Chen Sheng, and Wu Guang, who did not plan their uprising to the planned Huang Jin Insurrection, from the Huang Chao Revolt in the Tang Dynasty to the Li Zhicheng Rebellion that established a dynasty for only a month. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Even the Ming Dynasty created by Zhu Yuanzhang was only a cycle of other dynasties, and there were no systematic changes. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Zhu Yuanzhang, who came from a common family and did not receive much education, played the Chinese ancient centralized power system to a sick extent, and to extremes. Since then, the vigorous state of the type of the Tang Dynasty that was open, free, and tolerant, had become depressed. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The atmosphere of freedom of speech disappeared in the vast land of China for a time. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Human nature was suppressed to the maximum extent. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Everybody became very cautious and dared not to say more words with reverence and awe. </seg>
<seg id="23"> This was the only outcome of peasant uprisings in 2,000 years, and it made Chinese people neither humans nor ghosts. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Let's see the Medieval Ages of the so-called dark time in Western Europe. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The Medieval Ages of Western Europe were formed after the Western Rome was destroyed by nomadic nations, and lasted for a thousand years. They had nothing to do with the ancient Greece and Rome of the past. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Those ages featured the feudal system, i.e. land holding. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Many layers of land feudal lords, from the top to the bottom, had more autonomy. </seg>
<seg id="28"> No matter whether small feudal lords who had an area of several square kilometers, or nobles who had titles of Duke, Marquis, Count, Viscount, and Baron, since superiors and inferiors, and the left and right, could balance, restrain, and were interdependent with each other, and had their prerequisites and capabilities to strive for their own rights against kings, the scenes in which nobles sat with a king negotiating for their own interest emerged, which never happened in China's ancient times. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Compromises and concessions were made mutually instead use of violent means to knock down or replace opponents. </seg>
<seg id="30"> In this way, through making various contracts, rights were continuously transferred to nobles and common people, and they had more and more rights, and kings had fewer and fewer. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Later, the British Queen had only a status for display, and not any substantial power. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Democracy was gradually realized in this way! </seg>
<seg id="33"> Let's come back again to compare with ancient China, where every power was concentrated in the hands of emperors (except Li Shimin), and there were almost no nobles. It was very difficult for peasants to be able to sit in front of a negotiation table, joyfully making compromises and concessions on a contract agreed to by both sides while enjoying a cup of tea or a glass of wine. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Under this circumstance, when the living right was taken away, only violent means could overthrow an existing dynasty and try to replace it. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Its outcome was the repeated cycle from the peak of the Tang Dynasty to the sick status of the Ming Dynasty. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Comparing histories between China and the West, we discovered that the contradictions between rulers and the ruled in ancient China were much more intensified than those in ancient Western countries. </seg>
<seg id="37"> No Western countries had so many continuous peasant uprisings as ancient China had. </seg>
<seg id="38"> In the Western countries, when differences between ancient royal families and peasants emerged, what nobles and common people thought of first was to settle them through a negotiation path, to obtain more rights gradually by making mutual concessions, and they seldom used violent means. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Understanding this, when we enter into the 21st century, we can still see those democratic warriors in networks who have inherited the ideology of the absolute power concentration system of the Ming Dynasty, </seg>
<seg id="40"> and have been poisoned by the virus of the Cultural Revolution that they can say nothing except those words of "Down with or overthrow something." </seg>
<seg id="41"> And those concepts are the biggest barrier to democracy, because those people do not understand that negotiation, coordination, and compromise are the most important means and path for realization of democracy. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Cao Xiaoming: Who is Going to "Pay the Bill" for Enriching Cultural Activities in Rural Areas </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> Hou Ze </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> The author was lucky to spend this year's Spring Festival in a rural area of the Mainland, and visited some relatives and friends. </seg>
<seg id="4"> I was not only influenced by the dense atmosphere of the festival in the Chinese rural area, but also concerned about those boring cultural activities there. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The author discovered in a village where my relatives lived that this village organized villagers spontaneously to play a drama called "trotting horse lamp" for every Spring Festival in the past. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The drama is based on figures in the story of The Three Kingdoms. Any adult or child could play a role in the drama, and villagers were not bored at all to watch it a hundred times. </seg>
<seg id="7"> There were several of this kind of performance teams of "trotting horse lamp" in the whole township. They performed not only in their own villages, but also went to other villages for visits, and exchanged frequently. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But this village did not organize the performance this year. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The reason is that just the costumes for "trotting horse lamp" would cost a lot, which were bought in the past through donations from villagers. Now they are too worn out to be taken on. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Nobody was willing to donate any more, if asking villagers for donations household by household. Other villages in the township had a similar situation. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The village suddenly became quiet without the "trotting horse lamp." </seg>
<seg id="12"> Adults started to play Mahjong. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Children also began to play cards. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Villagers said that this festival had no fun. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The big scene in the countryside is either shooting off fireworks or playing Mahjong during the festival. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The gambling trend cannot be stopped even though it is prohibited time and again, and is spread even further. Gambling for up to ten thousand Yuan has become a routine game. Especially, big batches of those migrant farmer workers who come back to their hometowns from other areas have played major roles in gambling sites. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Their hard-earned money from working in other areas for a year is lost in this way. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Family disputes occurred time and again because of gambling, which sometimes causes tragedies with families broken up and decimated. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Some farmers said that they gambled not only during festivals but also participated in gambling frequently in slack seasons. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Nowhere to go if they did not gamble. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It is too difficult to organize cultural activities and look for "fun" in the countryside. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Not only are there no facilities and funding, but also nobody organizes them. </seg>
<seg id="23"> But in this aspect, the practice in Jiangxi is definitely good news for farmers. </seg>
<seg id="24"> To enrich the cultural life of the farmer masses, the government of Jiangxi Province not only implemented the policy that "the government provides funding for it; the market operates it; townships build stages; and farmers watch dramas" last September, </seg>
<seg id="25"> but they also arranged at least 60 million Yuan every year for the special fund for rural cultural causes and delivered good-quality cultural products to the rural masses. </seg>
<seg id="26"> In the beginning of this New Year, it added an additional 40 million Yuan, a total of 100 million Yuan, for the establishment of special funding for the rural cultural cause. </seg>
<seg id="27"> And also, what this special funding "paid" toward the farmers' "bill" is quite a good deal: </seg>
<seg id="28"> Various professional performance organizations are invited to have shows in rural areas, and provide at least four shows for every town each year. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Movie companies at every level are invited to organize film projection teams to show movies in the countryside, and at least six feature or scientific education movies should be shown for every administrative village each year; </seg>
<seg id="30"> Cultural activities with local features participated in by the masses are organized and developed at least two to three times for every township each year. </seg>
<seg id="31"> It is not difficult for us to see from the "purchase list" that the government does not simply pay the bill, but thinks hard how to use the limited funds in the critical area and deliver a cultural banquet that exceeds its money value to the farmer masses, and has done a big substantial thing for them. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Now, a lot of farmers are very happy and joyful for immunity from providing "royal grains and state's tax." </seg>
<seg id="33"> If every government can pay the "bill" for enriching cultural activities of the farmer masses as Jiangxi did, it would be another happy thing falling from the sky for farmers. </seg>
<seg id="34"> And this "happy thing" can not only liberate farmers from the Mahjong table, and make them "active" in cultural activities, but also add bricks and tiles for the construction of the new socialist countryside. </seg>

<seg id="1"> It Was a False Alarm that a Child of Wang Peirong Was Almost Hijacked </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> peirongwangsohu@gmail.com </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> It was a false alarm that a child of Wang Peirong was almost hijacked </seg>
<seg id="4"> The child of Wang Peirong recounted it completely at a little bit after 9 p.m. on the evening of January 24, 2006: </seg>
<seg id="5"> The child of Wang Peirong was called off by a gate guard when she was making up missed physics lessons at the Third Middle School of Xuzhou on the morning of January 24, 2006. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The guard said to Wang Peirong's child that three unidentified men had told the gate guard at the Third Middle School that Wang Tianjiao, the child of Wang Peirong, had not gone back home for three days because of discord between her parents. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Now her mother was missing, and they were leaders from her mother's work unit, and wanted to enter the Third Middle School and take away Wang Peirong's child. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Wang Peirong's child said: what the three men said was totally untrue. She refused to go with the three men. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Wang Peirong's child was not taken away with the help of the gate guard of the Third Middle School. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Wang Peirong's child called one of her mother's leaders at noontime to confirm it. The leader denied that he had sent his men to visit the Third Middle School. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Wang Peirong's child obtained a phone number of one of her father's leaders from her. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Wang Peirong's child called her father's leader. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Wang Peirong's child said: three men visited the Third Middle School and wanted to take me away. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The leader asked: why didn't you go with them? </seg>
<seg id="15"> Wang Peirong's child said: I would be dead for sure if I went with them. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Wang Peirong's child hung up the phone right away after she finished her words. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Wang Peirong felt that the case was serious after she listened to her child's description, and reported it to the police. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The feedback from a public security station on January 25 was that Wang Peirong's child's description was basically true. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The public security station asked the security unit of Kuangda if it had sent those men to look for Wang Peirong's child; the response was no. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The station asked the security unit again, and other units under Kuangda, if they had sent those men to look for Wang Peirong's child; their responses also were no. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Some related department passed on a message to Wang Peirong and her family members through another person, and asked them to pay attention to their security. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Leaders of some related department in Xuzhou City had paid close attention to the incident after it occurred. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The possibility of hijacking the child was excluded through an investigation done by the criminal detection unit of the Public Security Bureau of Xuzhou City. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Wang Peirong thanked leaders of related departments in Xuzhou City and the criminal detection unit of the Public Security Bureau of Xuzhou City. </seg>
<seg id="25"> This was a false alarm that was probably mainly caused by the gate guard at the Third Middle School. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Now the criminal detection unit of the Public Security Bureau of Xuzhou City finds out that, on January 24, three men, including leaders of the work unit of the Physics Institute where Wang Peirong works, called Wang Peirong, but could not find her (Wang Peirong still does not know what for so far). They tried to find Wang Peirong in a hurry and wanted to look for a teacher of Wang Peirong's child to ask if Wang Peirong's child was still in Xuzhou or not. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Heavy talking topic: why corruption has a lower risk but anti-corruption has a higher cost </seg>
<seg id="28">  http://bbs.people.com.cn/bbs/ReadFile?whichfile=44796&amp;typeid=39 </seg>
<seg id="29"> What a corrupted official cares about is those several related officials who are his superiors in the current cadre and anti-corruption mechanisms, not the masses of people. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Thus, once he feels that he has successfully deceived or tamed those several officials who can determine his fate, he would boldly do whatever he likes to conduct his great cause for accumulation of wealth through corruption, and could ignore the feelings of the masses of people that are only a few feet away from them. </seg>
<seg id="31"> On the contrary, if common people who do not have power in their hands take the initiative to oppose corruption, they might bring extremely brutal strikes and retaliation upon themselves, </seg>
<seg id="32"> or be imposed with political accusations, and end up with failure before achieving any victory. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Compared with the two sides, corrupted individuals have lower risk, but individuals who oppose corruption have to bear a higher cost. </seg>

<seg id="1"> We now turn our attention once again to the Iranian nuclear issue. </seg>
<seg id="2"> The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed on the 6th that the Iranian government had sent a letter to the IAEA requiring the removal before the middle of the month of all devices monitoring Iranian nuclear facilities. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Due to the IAEA's decision to report the Iranian nuclear issue to the UN Security Council, Iran has declared a halt to all supportive and cooperative measures taken in regards to the nuclear issue and said it would no longer authorize the IAEA to make surprise checks of its nuclear facilities. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Addressing the current tension over the Iranian nuclear issue, Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov said in Athens, Greece that that Russian-Iranian cooperation was ongoing. </seg>
<seg id="5"> And that it would become the motive force for a solution to the Iranian nuclear issue. </seg>
<seg id="6"> On the same day, a  Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman said that Russia's proposal to Iran about setting up a joint venture in Russia for enriching uranium was still valid. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The two sides may discuss the issue next week. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The same day, US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Lugar said at UN headquarters in New York that the US does not approve of an Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear facilities. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Recently, Israeli defense experts were reported as saying that, if necessary, the Israeli air force may heavily damage Iran's nuclear facilities. </seg>
<seg id="10"> According to Xinhua News Agencyï¼ Russian Vice Foreign Minister Kyslyak said on the 7th that Russia is willing to cooperate with Iran on the nuclear issue and help Iran obtain lawful power for the peaceful development of nuclear energy. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Kyslyak said that Russia's proposal about launching a joint venture for enriching uranium with Iran is still open. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Russia hopes to consult with Iran regarding the issue soon. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In late December last year, Russia delivered a proposal to Iran regarding the establishment of a joint venture for enriching uranium in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Both the EU and the US agreed that the plan was an acceptable compromise. </seg>
<seg id="15"> But Iran wants Russia to continue to revise the original plan. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Spokesman Kong Quan said on the 7th that although the IAEA reported the Iranian nuclear issue to the UN Security Council, the organization's responsibility for settling the issue has not been passed on to the Security Council. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Therefore, the parties concerned should still try to break the deadlock over the issue within the framework of IAEA. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Under an IAEA resolution, IAEA Director General El Baradei will deliver a report on the Iranian nuclear issue to the Security Council in March. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The Security Council will make a final decision after evaluating the report. </seg>
<seg id="20"> We believe that such a resolution, it talks about requiring the Iranians...well ... being able to implement the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and honor their commitments. Besides, it does not deliver the issue or pass it on to the Security Council. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Recently, China has been seeking a plan for the peaceful resolution of the Iranian nuclear issue through diplomatic channels. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Kong Quan said that on February 1, Zhang Yan, Director of the Department of Armament Control for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, met in Tehran with Ali Larijani, Secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council and Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, for talks on the Iranian nuclear issue. </seg>
<seg id="23"> China hopes that Iran should take full note of the concern of the international community and create conditions for the peaceful solution of the Iranian nuclear issue. </seg>
<seg id="24"> A solution for the Iranian nuclear issue within IAEA framework is not only in the interest of China. We firmly believe that it is also in the interest of all parties. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Therefore, we again appeal to the concerned parties in the international community not to abandon diplomatic efforts in respect to the issue. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Hamas, which is in the process of organizing a new Palestine autonomous government, officially announced that, with the exception of choice for prime minister, the list of cabinet members in the new government is essentially in order. </seg>
<seg id="2"> This triggered speculations among outsiders regarding the choice for the prime minister. </seg>
<seg id="3"> On the 8th, a senior Hamas official revealed to the Associated Press that Hamas intends to nominate Al-Khudairi , board chairman of Gaza's Islamic University (and a merchant), as prime minister of the new autonomous government, but the nomination has not yet been formally delivered to Abbas. </seg>
<seg id="4"> With the support of Hamas, 50-year-old Al-Khudairi took part in the election of Palestinian Legislative Council held last month in the capacity of independent candidate. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Al-Khudairi has never mentioned violence or anti-Israeli content in his open speeches. </seg>
<seg id="6"> But he once indicated that Palestine was in need of internal reform. </seg>
<seg id="7"> A senior delegation from Hamas is now visiting Cairo to discuss with Egypt issues related to the formation of a new Palestinian government by Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Khaled Mashaal, a delegation member, told the press on the 8th that although the international community and some Arab countries have been exerting constant pressure, the Palestinian government formed under the leadership of Hamas will not recognize Israel. </seg>
<seg id="9"> At the same time, Mashaal also warned Abbas in his speech not to take the liberty of changing the structure of the Palestinian leadership without first consulting with Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Analysts believe that this is a response to the intention of Abbas to appoint Interior Minister Nasser Yousef as deputy commander of the security troops. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In reply to questions about the establishment of a new Palestinian autonomous government, Mashaal refused to confirm the news that Hamas plans to nominate Al-Khudairi, board chairman of the Islamic University in Gaza (and merchant) as prime minister. </seg>
<seg id="12"> "The candidate for prime minister has not been decided yet," Mashaal said. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Prior to Meshaal's reiteration of the refusal to recognize Israel, another Hamas political leader, Marzuk, said in an Egyptian TV interview that Hamas would never recognize the legitimate status of Israel, but the new government would contact Israel in various fields, for it's one thing not to recognize Israel and it's another to contact with it. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Apart from the new and old hatreds between the three Hamas candidates for prime minister and Israel, the issue of territory ... eh ... has always been a difficult problem in Palestine-Israeli relations. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Acting Israeli Prime Minister Olmert said on the 7th in an interview with Israeli TV II that Israel must be separated from Palestine through the delimitation of permanent borders. </seg>
<seg id="16"> This means that Israel will have to pull out from part of the territory on the west bank of the Jordan River. </seg>
<seg id="17"> However, Olmert stressed that Israel would keep its control over large Jewish settlements on the west bank of the Jordan River and the river valley and maintain the integrity of Jerusalem. </seg>

<seg id="23"> China's Ministry of Commerce also set up an emergency response team following the incident. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Assistant Minister of Commerce Chen Jian said that if it cannot be assured that activity can be carried out in security, the cement plant project will not resume work. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Only when the security of construction personnel is assured can work be continued. </seg>
<seg id="26"> After the (emergency) group was set up, we immediately ... eh ... instructed our field personnel to go to the scene and complete an investigation of local conditions. </seg>
<seg id="27"> At the same time, here in China we verified the identity of the victims as quickly as possible. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Chen Jian said that the Ministry of Commerce would closely follow the handling of the incident and actively coordinate the relevant units in the handling of the necessary arrangements. </seg>
<seg id="29"> If security cannot be assured for the time being, we will require Chinese enterprises to suspend work. </seg>

<seg id="24"> Uh, we do know that there is one insurance policy against accidental injury for four-hundred thousand. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Um, with regards to compensation, currently the family members have not been in direct contact with the insurance company. Instead, it will be the work unit that will carry out negotiations with the compensation company regarding, uh, the, uh, with the insurance company regarding compensation. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Eh, currently that is what we understand regarding the situation. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Okay, thank you Mr. Li Guangyu for the on-site report. </seg>
<seg id="28"> In addition, this afternoon the survivors of the 2-15 terrorist attack, Yuan Fengyu, Xue Qijun, and Yang Wei, as well as a total of eleven other employees of the Hefei Cement Research Institute assigned to Pakistan's Balochistan boarded a plane to return to Hefei. </seg>
<seg id="29"> When the plane carrying the three survivors and eleven other workers arrived in Hefei, the people waiting out the airport let out a long sigh of relief. </seg>
<seg id="30"> We felt very gratified that they were able to return safely. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Our county is also very (()),and has been paying close attention to the affair. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Following the incident, appropriate shelter was organized for them. </seg>
<seg id="33"> And now they have been safely deliver to their homes. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Officials from Anwei Province and the China National Building Materials Group were at the airport to greet them and they expressed their condolences to the eleven workers. </seg>
<seg id="35"> They expressed their bitter grief for our comrades killed in this sudden incident in Pakistan. </seg>
<seg id="36"> They expressed an enthusiastic welcome to the other eleven comrades that today were able to safely return to the motherland. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In a related aspect, they explained that compensation for the victims and efforts to console their families were currently in progress. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Even though the remains of the three fallen Chinese engineers have left for China, Pakistan's investigation into the attack was still ongoing. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Only one hour ago, at two o'clock Beijing time, Pakistan police met with staff from the Chinese embassy in Pakistan to brief the Chinese on progress in the investigation into the incident. </seg>
<seg id="40"> We will now connect to this station's reporter in Pakistan, Tao Ye. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Hello, Tao Ye. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Yes, hello.   (()) </seg>
<seg id="43"> Okay. </seg>
<seg id="44"> In the meeting that was just held.... </seg>
<seg id="45"> (()) </seg>
<seg id="46"> In the briefing just held, what progress in the investigation was explained? </seg>
<seg id="47"> Uh, okay. </seg>
<seg id="48"> As you said, only an hour ago, the police chief from Pakistan's Balochistan province, which is the province where the incident occurred, his name is Yaqoob, he visited the China's [lu ba] consulate-general in Karachi to brief our ambassador to Pakistan, and also the consul general, on the status of the investigation by Pakistani police over the last two days into the incident. </seg>
<seg id="49"> In his briefing, he concisely explained the, uh, primary clues and targets the Pakistani police had in tracking down the assailants. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Eh, they maintain that the incident was probably the act of outsiders but that they surely had ties with some local residents. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Well, eh, they are now focusing on, uh, employees of the company for which the Chinese engineers worked. </seg>
<seg id="52"> They figure that these people might have fed information to the assailants and provided intelligence; for example, intelligence regarding the times the Chinese engineers departed and arrived at various locations. </seg>
<seg id="53"> In addition, they might have provided the assailants cover. </seg>
<seg id="54"> So these various aspects are what the police are currently focusing on. </seg>
<seg id="55"> According to the police chief, after two days of investigation they have questioned more than fifty people. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Presently, the scope of the investigation is gradually shrinking. </seg>
<seg id="57"> In addition, um, after the briefing was over, the police chief and other police officials also at...also went to the memorial hall set up in our country's consulate-general in Karachi to pay their respects to the three victims. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Uh, furthermore, something else of interest occurred. A group called the Balochistan Liberation Army (()) has claimed responsibility for the incident, but this news has not yet been confirmed by Pakistani, uh, authorities. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Uh, in responding to questions from this station's reporters regarding the incident, the police chief said that the %pw, the terrorist group is actually an extremely loose network  that does not have an intact organization. </seg>
<seg id="60"> And, eh, a lot of people become members of the group just by calling themselves members. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Uh, so, as far as the Pakistani authorities are concerned, they, uh, are still focusing the investigation on several actual individuals. </seg>
<seg id="62"> As for the group, uh, they are not regarding it as an especially key aspect. </seg>
<seg id="63"> Okay. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Okay, Tao Ye. </seg>
<seg id="65"> (()) </seg>
<seg id="66"> Um, we will continue to pay close attention to the status of the investigation into the matter. </seg>
<seg id="67"> Thank you Tao Ye for your on-site report. </seg>

<seg id="9"> Various organizations of other European countries and the US in Moslem countries are now working together closely. </seg>

<seg id="30"> Iranian extremists angry at the publication of cartoons of Mohammed once again attacked the Danish embassy in Tehran on Tuesday and threw Molotov cocktails. </seg>
<seg id="31"> At the same time, an Iranian state-run paper sought revenge by organizing a contest for cartoons depicting Nazis slaughtering Jews. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The US denounced the initiative as an arrogant attempt to take advantage of the situation to extend the consistent anti-Israeli stance of Iranian President Ahmadinejad. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Roughly twenty to thirty protestors climbed an enclosure to enter the compound of the Danish embassy in Iran. </seg>
<seg id="34"> A crowd of roughly three hundred outside also threw rocks and Molotov cocktails at the building. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The day before, student members of an Iranian hard-line militia group led hundreds of protesters in an attack on the Danish and Austrian embassies in Tehran. </seg>
<seg id="36"> The cartoons that gave rise to the controversy were first published in the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten last September. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Newspapers in other European countries and three Arab papers also carried the images. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Seeking revenge, Iran's best-selling newspaper, the Hamshahri daily, announced recently that it would hold a contest for cartoons depicting Nazi Germany's slaughter of Jews. </seg>
<seg id="39"> This move was denounced by the US and other countries. </seg>
<seg id="40"> US State Department Spokesperson McCormack said he said that the initiative by Iran's largest-selling  paper Hamshahri as an extension of the virulent anti-Israeli rhetoric of Iranian President Ahmadinejad. </seg>
<seg id="41"> McCormack reiterated US support for freedom of speech throughout the world, including in Iran. </seg>
<seg id="42"> But he saw no comparison between  Hamshahri's contest and the cartoons of Mohammed published in the Danish media. </seg>
<seg id="43"> McCormack said: I don't think anybody would draw any equivalences between freedom of the press in Iran and freedom of the press in Western Europe and the US. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Ahmadinejad has said that the Holocaust was a myth and called for Israel to be wiped of the map. This drew widespread criticism from the US and other countries. </seg>
<seg id="45"> McCormack said: Hamshahri is funded and printed by Tehran's conservative municipal government. </seg>
<seg id="46"> The holding of a cartoon contest on this occasion is in no way a coincidence. </seg>

<seg id="17"> This is the fourth quarter in a row that Japan has witnessed economic growth and the highest growth rate since the first and third quarters of 2005. It is primarily due to individual spending, capital expenditure and strong exports. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Immediately following the decision by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to refer the Iranian nuclear issue to the UN Security Council, Iran has reiterated that ... eh ... there is no room for negotiations with the US, one of the promoters of the decision. </seg>
<seg id="2"> Well ... an Iranian government spokesman said on Monday that the policy Iran has maintained to date in regards to relations with the US is not to engage in discussion or negotiation. </seg>
<seg id="3"> He said the west has committed a grave error in referring the nuclear issue to the Security Council in an obvious attempt to block the development of Iran. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Iran said on Monday that ... eh ... it would discontinue cooperation with IAEA, resume the extraction of enriched uranium and prohibit spot checks of its nuclear facilities. </seg>
<seg id="5"> So, on this issue, Iran's current attitude is pretty hard-line, ut the attitude of the United States is even more hard-line. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Eh ... US Defense Secretary Rumsfeld has repeatedly said that ... eh ... the use of force would not be ruled out in regard to this issue. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Well ... now there are rumors that the US military is putting such a plan into effect. </seg>
<seg id="8"> They are developing a super bomb, called the "Mother of All Bombs". </seg>
<seg id="9"> Eh ... once the Department of Defense gives the go-ahead, this super bomb will be used to blast Iran. </seg>
<seg id="10"> So, how big exactly is this Mother of All Bombs? </seg>
<seg id="11"> It has been said that, in terms of weight alone, the bomb weighs 30,000 pounds, equal to the weight of a double-deck bus. Also, its bulk is massive. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Such a super bomb has been developed mainly to bombard certain underground facilities of Iran. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Because of its massive penetrating power, it can penetrate concrete and also steel plate. It can roughly create a pit that is half a mile in radius and 60 feet deep, destroying several underground buildings and facilities. </seg>
<seg id="14"> So it now seems that in this respect the US has really begun to hone its sword or make the bomb. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Rumsfeld ... eh... said that, on this issue ... no means would be excluded as a solution to the Iranian nuclear issue and a resort to force had been put on the table. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Elsewhere, irrespective of the continuous escalation of the Iranian nuclear issue, an Iranian official in China said in an interview with this station that Iran actually would still work with the international community by persisting in peaceful negotiation ... eh ... in the hope of easing the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="17"> But he also added that Iran would adjust the details of cooperation with Russia on a nuclear project. </seg>
<seg id="18"> As for the second round of negotiations with Russia regarding the enriched uranium cooperation project scheduled for February 16, the Iranians said that the negotiations would go on as planned, though it was emphasized that the changes that have taken place so far will make it necessary to adjust the content of the negotiations. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Russia has previously been a steady supporter of Iran's peaceful utilization of nuclear energy and had said that it would remain stick to its position that the Iranian nuclear issue should not be referred to the Security Council. </seg>
<seg id="20"> But, as we can see now, they have agreed to referring the Iranian nuclear issue to the UN Security Council. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Given this new development, as a result we may make some changes to the policy we agreed on with Russia. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Before the UN Security Council ultimately decides in March whether to impose economic and political sanctions, Iran will advocate continuous negotiations with related international organizations and, in the meantime, remains willing to cooperate with the international community to ease the current crisis. </seg>
<seg id="23"> We stress the point that, for purpose of its own economic growth and national construction, Iran will not abandon the right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Iran has not violated any related international laws. We hope that the United States too will understand this. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The Iranian nuclear issue is completely different from the Afghanistan and Iraqi issues. </seg>
<seg id="26"> I think the US is pretty clear about that itself. </seg>
<seg id="27"> As for the so-called military strike, we haven't seen any clear-cut expression of attitude on the part of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="28"> We don't want to see the further escalation of the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Although we also make a point of using peaceful negotiation, we will not bow to pressure. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Additionally, ((A ge bi)) also said that he hoped China would continue on the basis of its existing standpoint to cooperate with Iran. </seg>

<seg id="17"> The capital Washington is also experiencing a snowstorm, with snowfall having exceeded 50 cm. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Grass and trees have all been draped in white attire. </seg>
<seg id="19"> But President Bush still attended a church service as usual. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Many of the city's resident have also stepped outside their homes in order to take in the beautiful winter scenery and profit from chance to play in the snow. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The National Weather Service's radars show snowfall stretching from eastern Virginia through to Maine. </seg>
<seg id="22"> In New Jersey, New York's Long Island, Connecticut and Maryland, power to homes and businesses was also cut following the snowstorm. </seg>
<seg id="23"> It is estimated that more than one-hundred and fifty thousand users are without power. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Large areas of Europe are also under the influence of a snowstorm. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The state of Bavaria in southern Germany has mobilized thousands of firefighters and soldiers to work with police and volunteers in clearing snowfall from rooftops and roads. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The Deggendorf region in eastern Bavaria is still under a state of emergency after several days of heavy snow. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Some small villages have lost contact with the outside world. </seg>
<seg id="28"> A roof collapsed under heavy snow in Bad Reichenhall in the state of Bavaria last month, killing fifteen people. </seg>
<seg id="29"> This is a news brief by Phoenix Satellite Television. </seg>
<seg id="30"> New York was of course among the cities affected in the northeast region of the US that was hit by the blizzard. </seg>
<seg id="31"> For the local situation, we will immediately connect with this station's reporter in New York, Luo Xiaoying. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Hello, Xiaoying. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Hello, Xiaonan. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Hi. </seg>
<seg id="35"> You've just been hit with so much snow, so what is the situation actually like there? </seg>
<seg id="36"> I hear that power has even been cut to some areas. </seg>
<seg id="37"> What areas have been affected? </seg>
<seg id="38"> Yes, that's right. </seg>
<seg id="39"> In fact, the...the area covered by the blizzard is extremely large. </seg>
<seg id="40"> I'm really happy to tell you that now we have finally seen the end of the blizzard. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Although the, the snowstorm was very violent, it didn't cause any serious injuries or fatalities. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Many states in the area hit in the eastern US  were affected: Maryland received 21 inches of snowfall; Pennsylvania got 19 inches; and the New York-New Jersey area was at more than 24 inches. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Snowflakes could be seen from Virginia to Maine, and even in Tennessee. </seg>
<seg id="44"> So, uh, as you just said, the, it resulted in power outages in many locations in the Washington region and Baltimore. </seg>
<seg id="45"> The total...total number of households affected by the power outage is approximately ten thousand or so. </seg>
<seg id="46"> New York is okay. The power outage, uh, power supply in the Manhattan area of New York City is normal. There are just some power outages in the Long Island area. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Rhode Island has declared a state of emergency. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Only snowplows and rescue vehicles such as ambulances are able to circulate on the roads. </seg>
<seg id="49"> As for traffic and transportation, relatively early on the New York, uh, area's three large airports were closed. </seg>
<seg id="50"> But, uh, we learned toward the evening that there appeared to be some movement toward resuming activities at Newark Airport in New Jersey and LaGuardia Airport in New York. </seg>
<seg id="51"> So there are some people who estimate that in a few hours from now those airports will open. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Delta Airlines, for example, has announced that all flights to places like Washington, Philadelphia, Boston, Baltimore and the state of Connecticut have been grounded until Monday. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Reagan Airport in Washington DC has already been opened. </seg>
<seg id="54"> Buses in the New York-New Jersey area are currently not running. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Trains are also operating at reduced frequency. </seg>
<seg id="56"> It, uh, it is now Sunday in New York. It is also the Lantern Festival. </seg>
<seg id="57"> And as for we Chinese, normally on the Lantern Festival some local Chinese communities have Lantern Festival activities, but these have all had to be cancelled. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Likewise, most of the activities that the people of New York normally take part in on Sunday have for the most part been cancelled. And, uh, no one is going outside, that is, they are all staying in their homes. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Um. </seg>
<seg id="60"> What is giving everybody a headache now is how to get to work on Monday. </seg>
<seg id="61"> The snow removal, or rather the accumulated snow could cause some flooding. </seg>
<seg id="62"> So the, uh, governments of the areas in the US being affected are now studying how to cope with the rush of people heading to work on Monday, as well as the rush of automobiles. </seg>
<seg id="63"> Xiaonan. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Okay. </seg>
<seg id="65"> Thank you Xiaoying for this latest report issued from the US. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Since there is nothing to be done, you might as well take a while to peacefully enjoy the beautiful snowscape. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Now let's look at some news items about Japan. </seg>
<seg id="2"> Koizumi has been contemplating upgrading the Japan Defense Agency to a Ministry so as to build up Japan's military muscle. </seg>
<seg id="3"> But, heated debates erupted during the process, which ran into one obstacle after another. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Recently, a scandal surfaced involving tenders for engineering projects offered by the Defense Facilities Administration Agency, an institution under the Defense Agency. As a result, some former and current officials have been arrested by the authorities. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Therefore, many people advised Koizumi to be careful in his move to upgrade the agency to a ministry. </seg>
<seg id="6"> And recently, Koizumi said that he had temporarily put the plan on the shelf rather then refer it to the parliament for review. </seg>
<seg id="7"> And he also hopes that the two parties in power can discuss the issue carefully and, eh, continue their consultations. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Elsewhere, here is some other news. If you go to Japan, there is now a new rule. </seg>
<seg id="9"> That is, Japan plans to, stipulates that most of tourists arriving in Japan must have their fingerprints and photos taken. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The move aims to prevent some unsafe individuals from entering Japan's borders and also prevent illegal immigration. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Er, so, it will probably be more troublesome going to Japan now. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Of course, recently there was one good news in Japan. </seg>
<seg id="13"> That is, Princess Kiko, wife of the second son of Japanese emperor, is pregnant. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This development has caused many Japanese to hope that she will give birth to a boy who will be heir to the throne. </seg>
<seg id="15"> But, she also threw the imperial family, which has always stayed relatively quiet, into a commotion. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Uh, in fact, Kiko is now of course a mature pregnant mother and she has all along been thought to be content with a family of four. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Being pregnant again at such an age, many people cannot help conjecturing that, uh, a fraternal scramble for the throne may arise in the imperial household. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Of course, many people are taking delight in talking about this conspiracy theory. </seg>
<seg id="19"> To explain this, one must go back to a few years ago. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Eh, it's like this. At that time, in 2002, because the wife of Crown Prince Naruhito, contracted depression, the imperial household did not place too much hope on them at the time and instead turned to the second prince, Fumihito, whom they put pressure on. </seg>
<seg id="21"> At the time, Fumihito did not do much in response. </seg>
<seg id="22"> But, by 2004, the contradiction intensified somewhat after Naruhito, uh, out of his care for his wife, reproached the imperial family on public occasions. </seg>
<seg id="23"> It is said that the imperial family were furious and asked his peer, Prince Fumihito to stand out and rebut his elder brother, accusing him of showing disrespect for the imperial family and doting upon his wife. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The brothers have been in discord from then on. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Now, if Prince Fumihito gives birth to a boy, the dominant role they play will become a pillar of the imperial household </seg>
<seg id="26"> and the East Palace, i.e. the crown prince will surely fall out of favor. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Eh, this is why many people say that, if things go on like this, the impact on the imperial household and the Japanese society will be tremendous. </seg>

<seg id="1"> United Nations Secretary General Annan visited the White House on Monday to meet with US President Bush. </seg>
<seg id="2"> In response to Iran's announcement that it was postponing nuclear talks with Russia, Annan urged Iran to halt nuclear activity as quickly as possible and to resolve the issue through negotiations and not confrontation. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Elsewhere, news sources have reported that the US Department of Defense has actually already begun in earnest to devise plans for bombing Iran as a last resort in case diplomatic efforts fail. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Originally, outside sources believed that Bush and Annan would discuss the possibility of the UN Security Council imposing sanctions on Iran, but the two did not make any announcement in that regard following the meeting. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Bush and Annan both reiterated that they hoped to resolve the Iran nuclear issue through negotiation. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Annan expressed concern over Iran's initiation of uranium enrichment activities and its decision to postpone nuclear talks with Russia. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The same day, US media reported, that Pentagon military strategists had begun seriously planning for military action against Iran so that if diplomatic efforts fails the US will use military methods to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Reports say that the US Central Command has started pinpointing attack targets. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The attack could possibly be by submarine-launched ballistic missile or B2 bombers. </seg>
<seg id="10"> On Monday, Annan urged all sides not to take actions that will intensify the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="11"> According to the analysis of some military experts, Iran could be capable of manufacturing a nuclear weapon within two years. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Furthermore, more than two years remain in Bush's second term. </seg>
<seg id="13"> He will endeavor to resolve the Iran nuclear issue before the end of his term, regardless of whether peaceful or military methods are used. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This is reported from Washington by Mou Naiqian of Phoenix Satellite TV. </seg>
<seg id="15"> On the 13th, Iranian President Ahmadinejad said that large superpower states that use their nuclear weapons to threaten other countries will disappear. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Ahmadinejad was meeting with the diplomatic envoys of various countries to Tehran on the occasion of the commemoration of the 27th anniversary of the victory of the Islamic revolution. </seg>
<seg id="17"> He said the arms race between countries and the fight to achieve hegemony will not bear fruit. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The hunger of the large superpowers will never be satisfied and they even go as far as to use nuclear weapons to threaten other countries. </seg>
<seg id="19"> But he said that the large superpower countries that rely on nuclear weapons to threaten other countries will disappear. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The day when mankind will have lasting peace and stability is close at hand. </seg>
<seg id="21"> So it can be seen that now, not only the war of words, but in actual truth, the sabre-rattling between Iran and the west and between Iran and the US has become more intense the longer it has gone on. </seg>
<seg id="22"> And because of the uncompromising attitude between Iran and the US, recently there have been certain changes in the situation. That is, Iran officially announced the day before yesterday that it would resume its plan to extract enriched uranium. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In fact, some western diplomats speculate that Iran had actually already resumed certain processes in the extraction of enriched uranium prior to this. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In addition, Iran also announced that it was postponing talks with Russia for an indeterminate period of time. The talks were to deal with Russia taking over the extraction of enriched uranium. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Of course, the postponement for an unlimited duration of the plan to hold talks was also brought about by the new situation that currently exists. </seg>
<seg id="26"> And recently, because the US has continued to threaten that it will attack Iran, the Oxford Research Institute, a British think tank, issued a report. </seg>
<seg id="27"> If the US actually employs military force, it will result in half the people being killed and furthermore would certainly spark a protracted wave of violence in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Also, terrorist attacks would also grow in intensity. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The price of oil would without doubt also surge in what would be one part of a domino effect. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Moreover, the report also says that if the US fails to subdue Iran, it will result in Iran resolving to move faster toward manufacturing its own nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="31"> We just spoke about the issue of talks between Russia and Iran. </seg>
<seg id="32"> In fact, a spokesman for the Iranian government said on Monday that because the situation had changed, Iran would postpone talks with Russian officials originally scheduled on the 16th regarding the extraction of enriched uranium inside Russia's border. </seg>
<seg id="33"> A spokesman for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: No official notice has yet been received from Iran. </seg>
<seg id="34"> It is therefore too early to say if the meeting will be postponed. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Furthermore, Russia's federal Atomic Energy Agency and the Commissioner of Energy Resources [Gu Jinuofu] said on Monday: Russian has prepared for talks with Iran on the nuclear issue and the conditions and principles for negotiation. </seg>

<seg id="1"> At the same time, recently the United States' New York Times published an editorial. </seg>
<seg id="2"> The title of the editorial was also very attention-grabbing. It was called Japan's Offensive Foreign Minister. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The editorial highlighted the fact that Japan's foreign minister, Taro Aso, has recently issued a string of shocking statements. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The statements were all extremely disingenuous and also extremely unwise, and they provoked widespread resentment in Asian countries. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The editorial likewise made special note of the fact that the Japanese should acknowledge their errors and learn their lesson, rather than, as is currently the case, avoiding mention in post-war educational material of the things they did during the war. </seg>
<seg id="6"> At the same time, the editorial also says that many of the opinions aired by Taro Aso, such as demanding that the prime minister pay homage at the Yasukuni Shrine and saying that colonial rule improved Taiwan's, uh, that Japanese colonial rule improved Taiwan's educational standards, and so on, that he would make such statements shocked people, and, well, it is clear that he is bereft of any knowledge of history and that his diplomatic skills are also extremely poor. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The New York Times had the third largest circulation in the US last year. It can therefore be considered influential in US society. </seg>
<seg id="8"> So this editorial should also have quite an effect. </seg>
<seg id="9"> At the same time, some former senior officials in the US government as well as some specialists in Asian issues have started a special discussion forum, that is, a discussion forum on Sino-Japanese relations. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In the discussion forum, some specialist put forth the following viewpoint. </seg>
<seg id="11"> They said Sino-Japanese relations were currently in a very tense period and that there was a potential danger of armed  conflict. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Moreover, they said that the possibility of armed conflict breaking out between China and Japan was currently even greater than that of armed conflict over the Taiwan Strait. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Uh, and once armed conflict breaks out, the US will definitely be dragged into it because the US is certain to become involved. </seg>
<seg id="14"> A spokesman from Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs who also participated in the forum said that Sino-Japanese relations were in truth at a very tense stage currently. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Any mistake could lead to serious consequences. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Elsewhere, the Georgian Parliamentary Committee on Defense and Security held a general meeting and decided to eject the Russian peacekeeping troops that are in the South Ossetia region. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Russia's parliament will hold a general assembly today in order to deliberate the proposal. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Uh, specialists say that if the proposal to expel Russian peacekeepers is approved, it could lead to a complete breakdown in relations between Georgia and Russia. </seg>
<seg id="19"> A spokesman for the Russian peacekeeping force said on the 14th that two military food-transport vehicles belonging to the Russian peacekeeping force were blocked by Georgian police and the driver was expelled. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Uh, the spokesman demanded that Georgia immediately halt such provocative activities, otherwise Russia would not bear responsibility for the consequences stemming from the incident. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The two military vehicles transporting grain and non-staple foods and belonging to the logistical system of the Russian peacekeeping forces were inspected on Monday night by Georgian police in the South Ossetia region of Georgia. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The on-duty Georgian police expelled the Russian driver and the detained personnel and forcibly removed the two military vehicles. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The incident has angered the Russian peacekeeping force. </seg>
<seg id="24"> A spokesman for the Russian peacekeeping force said that on February 1 the Georgian police confiscated a military vehicle in the region on the basis of a traffic accident. The truck has not yet been returned. </seg>
<seg id="25"> On February 8, it again used a visa problem as a reason to detain three Russian officers for two full days. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Georgia's arbitrary acts of provocation aim to cause a bloody incident in the region and force the Russian soldiers to fire their weapons, so that the peacekeeping force will withdraw from South Ossetia. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The same day, Russia's ambassador to Georgia issued an urgent petition to the Georgians, demanding that Georgia immediately halt its insane provocation, otherwise Russia would not be responsible for any conflict that resulted from it. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Media reported that on February 13 Georgian Defense Minister Okruashvili announced that the head of the Russian military base in Akhalkalaki sold the South Ossetians a number of  missiles used in Strela-type portable anti-aircraft missile systems. </seg>
<seg id="29"> On the same day, the Georgian Parliamentary Committee on Defense and Security held a general assembly and, after hearing a report by the law-enforcement department, decided to expel the Russian peacekeepers inside Georgia's border and ask the general parliamentary assembly on the 14th to deliberate on the matter. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Specialists believe that once the final decision is made, it could lead to a final and complete breakdown in relations between Georgia and Russia. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Prior to this, Georgian Minister of Minister of Foreign Affairs Bezhuashvili vehemently criticized the Russian position and rejected Russian President Putin's discourse that if the west recognized Kosovo, Russia might recognize Abkhazia and South Ossetia, saying that the Russian government was sending out encouraging signals to all separatist regions. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Prior to this, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs also said that it would protect Russians in South Ossentia, thereby implying a threat of military force directly against Georgia. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Admiral Roughead, commander of the US Pacific Fleet, announced on Tuesday that this summer the US ... eh ... would dispatch four aircraft carriers to the Asia-Pacific region to hold the largest military exercise in the past decade. </seg>
<seg id="2"> Roughead also said that the US ... eh ... would not view China as a threat. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The US military hopes to be able to hold joint exercises with the PLA navy again. </seg>
<seg id="4"> This statement immediately aroused the attention of US defense experts. </seg>
<seg id="5"> On Wednesday, the American think-tank the Heritage Foundation held a workshop on the Pentagon's Defense Review. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The subtle relationship between the report and the military exercise became one of the focuses of discussion. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Some people hold that Roughead's open invitation to China to take part in the exercise is an olive branch held out to China by the US. </seg>
<seg id="8"> While inviting China to take part in the exercise, the US military also expressed the hope that the operations of PLA would be more transparent. Therefore, some defense experts believe that this is evidence that the Pentagon is unclear about China's intention to expand its military force and hopes to use the joint military exercise as an opportunity for mutual probing and sounding out. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Furthermore, because the Defense Review released by the Pentagon early this month regards China as the greatest potential threat in the future, two defense experts have pointed out that the Asia-Pacific military exercise is the first step taken by the US Department of Defense to adjust its strategy on this basis. </seg>
<seg id="10"> This is reported by Xie Xiaoshuang of Phoenix TV from Washington. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Furthermore, ... eh ... the military exercise held by the US this summer is being watched carefully because this is the first time in the past decade that the US ... eh ... will have four aircraft carriers in a military exercise at the same time and also the first time since the Vietnam War that the US will move aircraft carriers from its east coast to the western Pacific region for such a military exercise. </seg>
<seg id="12"> And the military exercise ... eh ... actually, it is carried out frequently,  and will occur four times in these few months ... </seg>

<seg id="49"> Um, okay. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Uh, in addition, this is actually not the first time that Chinese engineering personnel have been killed in attacks in Pakistan. </seg>
<seg id="51"> A similar incident occurred in October 2004. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Two Chinese engineers were kidnapped by an armed group in South Waziristan. </seg>
<seg id="53"> In the end, one of the individuals was tragically killed in the rescue operation. </seg>
<seg id="54"> Also, three engineers were killed in a bomb attack in Gwador in May of the same year. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Let's take a look back. </seg>
<seg id="56"> On May 3, 2004, in the port of Gwador in the south of the Pakistani province of Balochistan, a vehicle carrying twelve Chinese headed toward a worksite at the port was hit by a car bomb attack. </seg>
<seg id="57"> As a result, three Chinese engineers were killed and nine individuals were injured. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Local armed separatists and tribal militants are believed to have launched the attack. </seg>
<seg id="59"> On October 9 of the same year, two Chinese engineers were kidnapped by armed militants in the area of South Waziristan in the border region between Pakistan and Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="60"> A short while after, one engineer was fatally shot as Pakistani troops were rescuing the hostages. </seg>
<seg id="61"> However, it is believed that the hostage-taking was carried out by armed militants linked to Al Qaeda and not armed separatists. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Because China has close economic ties with Pakistan and participates in infrastructure projects in that country, several Chinese engineers work there. </seg>
<seg id="63"> On the other hand, there are also armed tribal groups in Pakistan that accuse the government of plundering their natural resources. </seg>
<seg id="64"> This has resulted in Chinese becoming the victims of attacks or kidnappings on several occasions. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Let's take a look at some news items from  Japan. </seg>
<seg id="2"> Recently, Japan's political arena produced some rather sensational news. </seg>
<seg id="3"> That is, Tsuneo Watanabe, chairman of one of Japan's leading papers, the Yomiuri Shimbun, he ordered Yomiuri Shimbun to publish some articles ...eh ... that oppose Koizumi's visit to the Yasukuni Shrine, marking Yomiuri Shimbun's shift to a stand against Koizumi's visit to Yasukuni Shrine. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Eh ... so ... this Tsuneo Watanabe ..., in the speech he made a few days ago, he also lashed out at Koizumi ..., saying that he is ignorant and has no historical and cultural knowledge. </seg>
<seg id="5"> At the same time, he commented that visiting Yasukuni Shrine was just like paying tribute to Hitler and said that, in so doing, Koizumi ... eh ... had caused China and South Korea to ... eh ... regard Japan as a very dangerous country. This will bring endless troubles. </seg>
<seg id="6"> So why has Tsuneo Watanabe's attitude caused such a  repercussion? </seg>
<seg id="7"> In fact, he is very influential in political circles and has always been a major behind-the-scenes operator. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And he used to be a very rightist figure. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It should be said that he has always been a supporter of the hawks and strongly advocated revision of the constitution. </seg>
<seg id="10"> But, now, ... well ... this is really a major turn-around. </seg>
<seg id="11"> He turned his gun and ... eh ... opened fire  on Koizumi, adopting an attitude of opposition. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Actually, in 2004, when Koizumi was being criticized for visiting Yasukuni Shrine, this Tsuneo Watanabe ... he ... eh ... he said that he supported it and wanted Koizumi to withstand the pressure. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Recently, however, he made a speech, saying: "I am over 80 years old and don't have many days left." </seg>
<seg id="14"> So, he now stands up to make a high-profile speech with a very opposing attitude. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Such a turnaround of course produced a significant impact on the entire Japanese society. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Just as Tsuneo Watanabe himself put it, he said: "I am convinced that I have the strength to control and change the direction of the political winds." </seg>
<seg id="17"> And he also said that he would put up a desperate resistance if the government pressured Yomiuri Shimbun with respect to its freedom of speech or its ability to interview. </seg>
<seg id="18"> So, what has the situation come to now? </seg>
<seg id="19"> Well, Japan's largest newspaper, Yomiuri Shimbun, and the second largest newspaper, Asahi Shimbu...eh, these two leading newspapers have started to team up in opposition to Koizumi's visit to Yasukuni Shrine. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Originally, the two papers were opponents, but after the two chairmen met, they were able to reach agreement on this issue at least. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Therefore, they have now launched a campaign of considerable scale to criticize Koizumi. You can say that they have formed an ideal combination. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Actually, these two large newspapers have great sway over mainstream public opinion in Japan. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In a separate development, let's look at the meeting of the Japanese parliament. At a recent meeting, two candidates favored to succeed Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi made the same type of remarks. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Who were the two? </seg>
<seg id="25"> One was Chief Cabinet Secretary Shinzo Abe and the other was Minister for Foreign Affairs Taro Aso, who of late has frequently made astonishing remarks. </seg>
<seg id="26"> What did the two say? </seg>
<seg id="27"> They said that Japanese war criminals of the Second World War were not criminals. </seg>
<seg id="28"> What they mean is ... eh ... that, they claimed that these criminals ... it was the intention of the international court to convict them. </seg>
<seg id="29"> But, in Japan, according to international laws ... they were citing the domestic laws of Japan ... eh ... the war criminals ... did not break the domestic laws of Japan. </seg>
<seg id="30"> So, they think that, in Japan, World War II criminals should not be regarded as criminals. </seg>
<seg id="31"> This Shinzo Abe ... he also mentioned that Japan now ... eh ... should take the whole world into account, develop relations with the United States and develop commercial and trade relations with some East Asian countries, and, furthermore, it should also try to develop closer ties with India rather than always focus on China. </seg>

<seg id="1"> <HEADLINE> Chance at the Championship, But It's Not a Sure Thing </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> <POSTER>  Love life, love Lu Neng </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> The China Football Association Super League is set for some fierce battles. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Luneng Taishan is getting combat-ready for the new season with the championship in mind. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Hot competitions will be triggered between the Dalian, Shandong and Shanghai teams, the three strongest competitors for the championship. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In the end, who will win the championship? </seg>
<seg id="7"> Based on an analysis of their strengths, Taishan has a very good chance to become champion, but it is by no means a sure thing. </seg>
<seg id="8"> First of all, the new team members have not had long enough to get worked in. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Taishan lost at four major events last year. </seg>
<seg id="10"> This year, Taishan recruited two players from the national team--Li Leilei and Wang Liang. With the addition of two foreign players soon afterwards, it is safe to say that the team will be stronger. </seg>
<seg id="11"> But because the national football team is preparing for matches with Palestine and Iraq, there no way to say how well the two players from the national team will integrate. </seg>
<seg id="12"> By the time they return to the club, league matches will be set to begin. </seg>
<seg id="13"> That is why integration has become the most significant issue Taishan is facing. </seg>
<seg id="14"> In my view, the national-team players can be used as backups in the first few rounds of league matches. </seg>
<seg id="15"> First, team integration can be achieved using the in-game training. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Second, the national-team players who have just played group matches with the national team can use the lull to rest up. </seg>
<seg id="17"> After a few rounds, when the "knife is well sharpened', it will not be too late for them to play top spots. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In addition, the defense has some weaknesses. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Last year, Taishan's fans had some unfavorable things to say about the team's defense. </seg>
<seg id="20"> This year, the defense will have improved with the recruitment of Li Leilei. But it's still not the time to sit back and relax. </seg>
<seg id="21"> There's still the problem of sluggish turnaround at the center back position, and the substitutes for this position are either too old or lacking in experience. </seg>
<seg id="22"> If performance at the center back position can be stabilized, Taishan will gain some momentum on the road to becoming champion. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In my opinion, they might as well use Ren Yongshun, who is strong physically. Although he lacks experience, he should be put to work this year so as to be ready in the future. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In addition, Gao Yao can play center back as well. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Taishan has quite a few players who can play defending midfield, such as Cui Peng and Hai Bing. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Gao Yao is physically very strong and a ferocious interceptor. He should be able to handle the center back position. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Another question is whether the foreign recruits can adjust. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Taishan has been plagued by problems with foreign recruits. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The performance of Daniel [Daniel Danciulescu] last year was far from stellar. </seg>
<seg id="30"> We know that this year's selection of foreign players has not yet been finalized. </seg>
<seg id="31"> I think that apart from bringing in an excellent striker, a true left-footed midfielder should also be recruited this year. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Except for Xing Rui, who played for the team a few years ago, Taishan has not had a true left-footed player with good skills. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Although players like Cui Peng and other can play the position, a truly competent left half back would be greatly preferred to fill-in. </seg>
<seg id="34"> If these three issues can be solved, Taishan's road to the championship should be somewhat smoother. </seg>
<seg id="35"> As a Shandong football fan, I'm really hoping Taishan can win the championship this year. </seg>
<seg id="36"> But to be frank, with things looking like they do in the championships this year, Taishan has a good chance, but it is far from a sure thing. </seg>

</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> <POSTER>  BrandVista Post: </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> Hello, everybody. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Once again, the Chinese New Year has flown by and those who combined their vacation time with their New Year's holiday are now returning to their jobs. </seg>
<seg id="5"> We wish all our friends a happy New Year, if it is not too late to say Happy New Year. </seg>
<seg id="6"> We spoke recently at a cafe with NPLCN. He talked about present-day Brandvista. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The appearance of the website has improved greatly. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The content is well structured. </seg>
<seg id="9"> What pleases him most is the Discuz-powered community BBS, which has undergone a thorough revamping. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In regards to the community, I must thank one person. </seg>
<seg id="11"> That is, Mr. Li Mingshun, general manager of Discuz Beijing. </seg>
<seg id="12"> If you search for his name in Google, you will get a slew of hits. </seg>
<seg id="13"> You probably know that he was previously with Sina. He later started his own business, setting up an Internet advertisement exchange platform for SMEs that was similar to the overseas website Adbrite.com. </seg>
<seg id="14"> We discussed it with him at the time on MSN. What he said, in general, was that: Brandvista felt that the development of many industries in China depended on the expansion of the private economy and SMEs. </seg>
<seg id="15"> And currently, in the Chinese market, this situation does not give reason for optimism. </seg>
<seg id="16"> So SME's in creative industries and similar services are unable to provide consultation to any significant extent. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Collecting high fees to advance one's own development in the end leads to a discouraging cycle. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Later, he came to Discuz. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Discuz is an outstanding forum program powered by PHP and MySQL. </seg>
<seg id="20"> With the help of Ramboo, a technical engineer from Beijing, Brandvista finally saw the light of day once again and hit the stage with matchless freshness. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The feedback was very good. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The interface was neat and friendly. </seg>
<seg id="23"> It was also very fast. </seg>
<seg id="24"> With the neat interface, writing a few words that moved me and inspired others, exchanging tidbits about work and life with friends from the same industry that shared the same pursuits, I began to find that this was a pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Thank you Discuz! </seg>
<seg id="26"> Recently, there has been a lot of news from the advertising industry. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Starting in January, the WTO system of openness in the ad industry began to be implemented. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Large foreign companies have been arriving one after another. Small foreign companies are sharpening their sword for battle. It seems to be a scene of prosperity. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Batey Ads, which rose to prominence in Singapore, has been having many difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Having lost a string of big clients and having suffered repeated setbacks in its development in mainland China, Martin Boase finally took a little time from a lawsuit in Italy to think about shuffling things around. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Batey Ads will merge into JWT's network, keeping its own brandname and being managed by JWT. </seg>
<seg id="32"> However, at the same time, there were also rumors that Bates and 141 Network would merge into the Ogilvy and Mather system and be managed by the Ogilvy and Mather network. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Even if 141 had already given its report to Ogilvy and Mather prior to that, having Ted Bates get payback against Ogilvy and Mather is also a interesting matter. </seg>
<seg id="34"> During the Spring Festival, several articles on the website were updated. We won't go into each one here. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Everybody can go to the website to take a look when they have time. </seg>
<seg id="36"> At the same time, friends who still haven't entered the new forum can, with a few extra clicks of a mouse, enter into Brandvista's completely new community. </seg>
<seg id="37"> You can get a feel for the environment, get to know the atmosphere and contribute a few words. </seg>
<seg id="38"> We hope you will find pleasure in finding the group. </seg>
<seg id="39"> We wish all friends a pleasant mood. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Goodbye. </seg>

<seg id="2"> <POSTER>  Helen Li </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> I saw this article and decided to share it with you; </seg>
<seg id="4"> This is not a momentary impulse, but rather a warm kindheartedness that has long existed in the heart. </seg>
<seg id="5"> I asked myself what I would do if it were me. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The answer is very clear. I would way, "You have the wrong number" and hang up the telephone. </seg>
<seg id="7"> I've been thinking all this year about how one can actually help someone. </seg>
<seg id="8"> I have already given up on actions such as donating money or goods. </seg>
<seg id="9"> A couple days ago a friend said, "I already have no spare time to take care of myself. As for helping people, the heart is there by the means are not." </seg>
<seg id="10"> Have a nice day :) </seg>
<seg id="11"> Helen </seg>
<seg id="12"> A Mother Ten Years in the Past </seg>
<seg id="13"> It was a day ten years ago. The teacher was using the lunch break to nap at home, when suddenly the telephone rang. </seg>
<seg id="14"> She answered and heard an unfamiliar rough voice from the receiver: "Your child stole a book and we caught her. Come over right away!" </seg>
<seg id="15"> The crying of a little girl could also be heard though the receiver, as well as the sound of somebody nearby scolding her. </seg>
<seg id="16"> She turned her head to look at her only daughter watching the television and then immediately understood what was happening. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Clearly, a little girl had been caught by a store clerk stealing a book and did not want her family to find out, so she dialed a number at random and happened to call there. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Of course, she could hang up and forget about it, or even reprimand the party on the other line, </seg>
<seg id="19"> because this affair had absolutely nothing to do with her. </seg>
<seg id="20"> But she was a teacher, and it could be that it was one of her students. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Through the telephone, she could roughly imagine that the little girl who had made a mistake on the spur of the moment was surely terrified, since she was facing what could be life's most frightening circumstance. </seg>
<seg id="22"> After hesitating a moment, a thought suddenly came to her mind. Yes, she would do it. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Thereupon, after asking the bookstore's address, she rushed over there. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Just as she had anticipated, standing in the bookstore was a little girl with a face full of tears. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The adults beside her were ferociously and loudly scolding her. </seg>
<seg id="26"> She instantly rushed forward and gathered the pitiful little girl into her arms, then turned toward the nearby store clerk and said: "Whatever you have to say you can say to me. You shouldn't frighten children." </seg>
<seg id="27"> During the muttering of the somewhat unwilling store clerk, she paid the fine of less than one hundred yuan and then, with the little girl in hand, walked out of the store where she could see clearly the face overwhelmed by panic and tears. </seg>
<seg id="28"> She smiled and returned home with the little girl where she tidied her up without asking anything, then let the little girl leave, </seg>
<seg id="29"> As the little girl was about to go, she also made a point of urging, "If you want to read a book, then come here to Auntie's house. There are lots of books here.' </seg>
<seg id="30"> The still badly shaken little girl looked are her deeply for a moment, then dashed off, after which she never came back. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Time rushed by like running water. Imperceptibly, ten years went by in a flash. </seg>
<seg id="32"> She had forgotten the incident, still living there as before, she led a calm and peaceful life. </seg>
<seg id="33"> One afternoon, there was a knocking on the outside door. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Opening the door to her apartment, she saw a pretty young woman she did not know. The girl was smiling broadly and in her hands she held a stack of presents. </seg>
<seg id="35"> "Who are you looking for?" </seg>
<seg id="36"> she asked with uncertainty. </seg>
<seg id="37"> The young girl excitedly gave a long explanation. </seg>
<seg id="38"> To her surprise, from the unfamiliar young lady's story she suddenly realized that the young woman was actually the little girl from that year. Ten years later, she had graduated from university without difficulty and had now come especially to call on her. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The young woman's eyes glistened with tears as she said in a gentle voice: "Although I still don't understand even today why you were willing to pass yourself off as my mother and come to my rescue, but for the last ten years I had a constant feeling that I wanted to cry out 'Mother' to you." </seg>
<seg id="40"> The teacher's eyes started to cloud over as well. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Somewhat curious, she asked: "If I hadn't helped you that day, what would have been the result?" </seg>
<seg id="42"> The young woman's face instantly darkened and she lightly shook her head, saying: "I'm not sure. Maybe I would have gone on doing stupid things, or I might even have died." </seg>
<seg id="43"> A violent shiver went through the teacher's heart, then she rejoiced to  herself. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The impetuous decision that she had made back then had unexpectedly had such an influence on a person's entire life. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Looking at the happy smile on the young woman's face, she also began to smile. </seg>

<seg id="49"> Human nature is good at the outset. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Everybody has a compassionate heart. </seg>

<seg id="1"> <HEADLINE> Military Observation: How Long Can Iran Hold Out under US Air Attacks? </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> <POSTER>  Yun Feiquan </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> If we describe conventional war of attrition as causing the opponent to bleed to death, then from the outset modern warfare consists of shooting a gun toward the opponent's head in order to render him a "vegetable" even before there is time to bleed. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The disparity between the military capabilities of Iran and the US is not one of quantity, but rather in the understanding of modern war. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Iran, which fought a victorless eight-year war with Iraq, seems not yet to have understood the true significance of modern hi-tech warfare. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Following an analysis of US military deployments, Britain's "International Intelligence--Commentary" recently said that the US military is carrying out preparations to launch a large scale air assault on Iran...... </seg>
<seg id="7"> The current status of Iran's air force is cause for concern. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The present situation of Iran's air force is quite similar to that of Iraq's air force prior to the 2003 war. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The country does not possess the capacity to research and develop modern weapons on its own and is also under an arms embargo imposed by the west. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Once war breaks out, it is uncertain whether the antiquated planes in Iran's air force will be able to take to the air to engage US forces. </seg>
<seg id="11"> At present, Iran's air-defense system consists primarily of an air force belonging to Iran's regular forces, the land-based air-defense force and the air-defense capacity of the revolutionary guard. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Of these, Iran's air force presently has a manpower of 50,000 and more than 300 aircraft of various models. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The most important aircraft models include US-manufactured F-4 Phantoms, F5 Tigers, F-14 Tomcats and Russian-manufactured Mig-29s. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The land-based air-defense force is primarily equipped with surface-to-air missiles of the US-manufactured Hawk series and the British Rapier series, as well as a portion belong to the Russian-manufactured SAM series. </seg>
<seg id="15"> With regards to the current status of Iran's air-defense strength,  analysis by individuals such as the US military expert Harold Hutchison and  military expert [Hela Muqixin] of the [Russian Political and Military Research Institute] indicates that, viewed from the present situation, there are still holes in Iran's air-defense capabilities and air-defense system. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Hutchison says that with respect to overall capabilities, Iran's air force simply is not on the same level as the US air force. </seg>
<seg id="17"> A large number of the US-manufactured jetfighters that Iran is equipped with cannot be used because of a lack of spare parts and upgrading. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The F-14 fighter was once the trump card of Iran's air force, but today there are only ten or so that are able to fly. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The dependability in actual combat of the AIM-54 Phoenix missiles they carry, known for their ultra-long distance attack capabilities, is also doubtful. </seg>
<seg id="20"> [Hela Muqixin] points out however that the air-defense missile systems provided to Iran by the US in the 1970s and 1980s have lost their warfare capabilities because of a lack of spare parts. </seg>
<seg id="21"> In addition, the other non-systematic air-defense weapons obtained from Russia and other countries are simply incapable of countering US forces possessing powerful electromagnetic countermeasure capabilities. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Scraping Together a Military Affects Battle Capability </seg>
<seg id="23"> Clearly, Iran's government is also aware that its fate in a conflict depends upon whether it can defend the sky above and it has been carrying out eleventh-hour preparations by scraping together whatever it can find in order to build up its air-defense system. </seg>
<seg id="24"> At present, its methods can be summarized into two devices: </seg>
<seg id="25"> The first is an all-out effort to conceal key nuclear facilities and beef up their defense capabilities. </seg>
<seg id="26"> According to a report in the British newspaper The Times, Iran has hidden the Natanz Nuclear Facility, the Isfahan Uranium Enrichment Center and other core components of their nuclear facilities eighteen meters underground and added a two-meter thick concrete protection shell. </seg>
<seg id="27"> But the US military is one step ahead. As early as the 1991 Persian Gulf War, it saw the effectiveness of underground bunkers in anti-aircraft defense and rushed to develop various types of earth-penetrating bombs. </seg>
<seg id="28"> After ten years of focused research, the US military has a full complement of strategies and weapons to counter reinforced underground bunkers. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Iran has recently also bought a large amount of advanced air-defense weapons from Russia. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Since the end of last year, Iran's government has reached a series of agreements with Russia to purchase Pechora-2A air defense missile systems as well as 29 Tor-M1 air-defense missile systems valued at US$700m. </seg>
<seg id="31"> However, modern warfare is a contest of system against system. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The various air-attack weapons of the US military have all been developed by the country itself for its own benefit and, through many years of perfectioning in actual combat, they have been molded into an impressive war machine. </seg>
<seg id="33"> On the other hand, Iran's "up-to-date weapons" have been scraped together from other countries. Whether or not they can be made combat effective in such a short time is still in question. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Iran's Lags Behind Not Only in Weapons </seg>
<seg id="35"> The concept of "air-land battle" was first raised in "Operations", published by the US military in 1982. It stresses reliance on strength in the air to carry out attacks against the enemy's strategically valuable targets. This paralyses the other side's command systems at the start of the war and turns the enemy's conventional forces, even if they are superior, into a "slab of meat on a cutting board." </seg>
<seg id="36"> In the 1991 Persian Gulf War, the 1999 Kosovo War and the 2003 Iraq War, the US military did not concern itself with how many planes the opponent had, but rather the range of its own Tomahawk cruise missiles. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Even if Iran's government has prepared for a possible air attack and has begun to take steps to reinforce its air-defense capabilities, Iran, which fought to a stalemate in an eight-year war with Iraq, seems not to have fully understood the true meaning of modern hi-tech warfare. </seg>
<seg id="38"> With the progress of the US military's military transformation in recent years, the US military's air-attack operations are completely different from the carpet bombing of the Vietnam War and instead rely on full-depth air assaults with various hi-tech weapons and modern information technology. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Faced with this kind of air assault, how long Iran's land-based air defense systems can hold out is an unknown. </seg>

<seg id="1"> <HEADLINE> Joining Hands with Google to Battle Microsoft: Will Dell Charge Microsoft "Top-Shelf Fees"? </seg>
</hl>

<seg id="2"> <POSTER>  Yun Feiquan </seg>

<seg id="3"> Dell Inc. (US: DELL) and Google confirmed on Tuesday that Dell is currently testing PCs installed with Google's software pack. </seg>
<seg id="4"> This step could form a significant threat to Microsoft's (MicrosoftCorp., MSFT) dominant position in the PC software market. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Dell spokesman Jess Blackburn said the company is currently evaluating Google's software. </seg>
<seg id="6"> After the software has been installed, the PC-user will be able to use the software to conduct searches on the Internet as well as search through information stored on the PC. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Blackburn confirmed that the software being evaluated by the company includes a Google-supported Dell homepage, a Google desktop search tool and a Google tool bar. </seg>
<seg id="8"> At the same time, Google spokesman Jon Murchinson also confirmed that the company was working with Dell in testing a software bundle developed by Google. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Earlier, a report in the Wall Street Journal had said that IT upstart Google was in talks with Dell and Hewlett-Packard in an attempt to convince the computer manufacturing giants to install Google software in their computers. </seg>
<seg id="10"> According to an insider quoted by the Wall Street Journal, in order to achieve this end, Google may have to pay up to US$3bn over the next three years. </seg>
<seg id="11"> However, the two companies have not disclosed any relevant details. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Furthermore, HP still refuses to issue a comment. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Microsoft spokesman Neil Charney refused to comment on the above information. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Currently, Microsoft is planning to launch a search tool for the next generation of its Windows operating system and strengthen the development of its online business. </seg>
<seg id="15"> On the day of the news statement, shares in Google fell another 4.46% to US$367.92. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Shares in Microsoft fell that day by 1% to close at US$26.94. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Some analysts say that Google is eagerly seeking to expand in a direction beyond web searching and that linking up with Dell and other PC giants could prompt Google to threaten Microsoft in its core businesses. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Matt Rosoff, analyst with the market research firm Directions on Microsoft, says that Microsoft is unquestionably concerned and worried by Google's eagerness to expand into other sources of revenue. </seg>
<seg id="19"> But other analysts strongly disagree. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Charles Di Bona, analyst with market research firm Sanford C. Bernstein, says that it is still too early to talk about Google shaking Windows' dominate position. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Reporter Handbook: Is Google shaking up Microsoft's landscape? </seg>
<seg id="22"> Hui Zhengyi </seg>
<seg id="23"> Without doubt, the computer has become a necessity in modern man's life and work. </seg>
<seg id="24"> But while everybody has become familiar with operating computers, only a small portion of people understand the working principles behind a computer. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Just like with an "idiot" camera, if the interface is friendly and the software is convenient and quick to use, the vast majority of "newbies" can find their way around the black box that is a computer. </seg>
<seg id="26"> For this reason, the software originally installed by the PC manufacturer more often than not determines the usage habits of most consumers. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Indeed, it was through this measure that Microsoft took firm hold of the market for PC operating systems. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Now, Microsoft's new rival, Google, also intends to use this method to take a piece of the pie. </seg>
<seg id="29"> In regards to this, a well-known organization in the Taiwanese economic media recently made an interesting analogy. </seg>
<seg id="30"> "Dell, HP and other computer manufacturers are starting to treat the computers they produce as supermarket shelves and they are charging 'top shelf fees' to software companies. </seg>
<seg id="31"> The winning bidder can cause its software to appear in the 'crucial ten minutes' after the user turns on the new computer and thereby induce the consumer to use their product. </seg>
<seg id="32"> This type of fee method is like the top-shelve fees charged by supermarkets to food companies." </seg>
<seg id="33"> Without doubt, this phenomenon indicates that Microsoft's control is being shaken. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Microsoft's managers have warned Bill Gates, saying that if Google starts paying money to PC manufacturers in order to have computers shipped with Google software installed, then Microsoft's position as overlord will ultimately be threatened. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Whatever the final outcome, Microsoft's easy days safely perched at the top of the ladder might become history. </seg>
<seg id="36"> After all, keeping a market is much more difficult than creating a marketã </seg>

<seg id="3"> The Sword of Righteousness: Outlook for 2006 </seg>
<seg id="4"> Author: Sword of Righteousness </seg>
<seg id="5"> I remember that at the beginning of 2005 Hong Kong's Apple Daily carried an article titled "Falun Rotates Continuously and Its Gong May Be Able to Defeat a Regime". </seg>
<seg id="6"> The article states that 2004 was a year in which Falun Gong advanced triumphantly. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The article lists examples of various occasions and situations where suppression of the Falun Gong movement by mainland China's overseas officials failed and relates how Falun Gong practitioners speaking the truth around the world have caused mainland China to completely lose face. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But 2004 doesn't seem to have been anything special when compared to the powerful momentum of 2005's Withdraw-from-the-Party Movement, which was caused by the book Nine Commentaries on the Communist Party. </seg>
<seg id="9"> So, what will 2006 bring? </seg>
<seg id="10"> We can probably get a hint of how this year will develop from two events that occurred at the start of the year. </seg>
<seg id="11"> One was the publication of "On Eliminating Evil" by the creator of Falun Gong. The article pronounced that, following July 20, 1999, the final days of mainland China's secret agents were nigh. </seg>
<seg id="12"> As for this article, many people may half believe it or disbelieve it. </seg>
<seg id="13"> But regardless of whether it is believed or not, history and facts will prove it! </seg>
<seg id="14"> Of course, the Chinese Communist Party's secret agents are like rats that live in the sewers. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Their "natural or accidental" death will not attract the attention of society and public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="16"> But the large scale striking down or repentance of the CCP's overseas secret agents will inevitably deliver a heavy blow and a great shock to the power-wielding strata of the CCP. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Frightened by the awe-inspiring threat of being struck down, they have no choice but to carefully consider their own means of escape and survival---withdrawing from the Party, defecting and fighting against the CCP. </seg>
<seg id="18"> For this reason, the CCP's "ultra-stable bureaucratic organization", held together by squalid self interest, will start to move toward shakiness, disintegration and collapse! </seg>
<seg id="19"> Another event was the human-rights hunger-strike protest movement launched by Gao Zhisheng. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It erupted suddenly and initially wasn't well-regarded, but it unexpectedly received an enthusiastic response from around the world as well as a collective response from people from all walks of life and various influential bodies. </seg>
<seg id="21"> If this movement can become a bond bringing together the suffering people and various influential bodies fighting for justice, and can be made stronger, then there might be hope that the outside force that deals the final blow to  the CCP, an evil regime in a very precarious situation, may take shape from here. </seg>
<seg id="22"> If it can be said that 2005 was the year that the Communist Party was destroyed at the spiritual level, then in 2006 things will have entered into the stage where the Communist Party is destroyed at the spiritual and material level. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Following further dissemination of the Nine Commentaries and growth in the wave of withdrawals from the party, the disintegration of the CCP and the consolidation of external forces fighting for justice, the countdown has begun for the end of the lifespan of the fiendish CCP! </seg>
<seg id="24"> The will of heaven and the will of the people have merged. The strength of the spirits and the strength of man are joining together. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The heavenly sword is pointing straight at the demon CCP! </seg>
<seg id="26"> If it can be said that 2004 was a year of marching forward in militant song and 2005 was a year of moving forward with great momentum, then what will be the closing assessment of  2006? </seg>
<seg id="27"> I hope it is an earthshaking radical change and triumphant return in victory! </seg>

<seg id="5"> Title: Xu Zhiyong: A Letter to Li Qun, Party Secretary of the Linyi CPC Municipal Committee--By Using Hooligan Tactics, You Will Harm Yourselves Too. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Website of origin: yjrg.net (Wed Feb 8 13:56:14 2006), current website (yjrg.net) </seg>
<seg id="7"> As of yesterday, the government of Linyi, of which you are the leader, has held Chen Guangcheng under illegal house arrest for 165 days. </seg>
<seg id="8"> You have joined with hooligan and gangland elements to illegally imprison a law-abiding citizen who is completely blind. </seg>
<seg id="9"> You have cut his home's telephone line and installed mobile phone interrupters in his courtyard. </seg>
<seg id="10"> On several occasions, you have also beat him or members of his family. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Your barbaric acts have transgressed the lowest limits of civilized society. </seg>
<seg id="12"> At the beginning of October, 2005, you employed hooligan gangland tactics to beat the lawyer Li Fangping and myself, but we have been patient and have always done our best to understand the difficult situation you are in. For a period of time, we even tolerated that you had placed Chen Guangcheng under house arrest. </seg>
<seg id="13"> But 165 days have gone by and you still haven't restrained yourselves. On the contrary, you have intensified your efforts. </seg>
<seg id="14"> You have dispatched large contingents of police and thugs to harass the villagers. </seg>
<seg id="15"> You have continued to arrest and beat villagers. </seg>
<seg id="16"> You have gone too far! </seg>
<seg id="17"> Today, as you continue to organize underworld thugs to surround Chen Guangcheng, we clearly warn you that thuggish underworld tactics will in turn come back to hurt you. </seg>
<seg id="18"> You need to rethink this affair from its beginning. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Province wide, Linyi ranks last in planned parenthood. </seg>
<seg id="20"> As municipal party secretary, it is understandable that you are somewhat anxious. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But you are mistaken in your belief that the people of Linyi are of such low upbringing that it is necessary to use violence and coercion to implement state laws and policies. </seg>
<seg id="22"> If citizens do not act in concert with the actions of government, in the end whose fault is it? </seg>
<seg id="23"> Is it because the citizens are of low upbringing or is it because for a long time the government has engaged in so much lying and deception that its public credibility is too low? </seg>
<seg id="24"> Assuming that ten years ago the same type of actions by government didn't seem so outrageous, don't you feel that, in 2005, when Chinese society has made clear progress and human-rights guarantees have been written into the constitution, your savage acts seem ludicrous? </seg>
<seg id="25"> Think about it for a moment. How is it that only you people in Linyi dare to act this way? </seg>
<seg id="26"> How is it that only you people in Linyi are unable to enforce the law using democratic and legal methods? </seg>
<seg id="27"> In the wake of the reports by Chen Guangcheng and other courageous citizens regarding the savage enforcement of laws, the brave intercedence by Teng Biao and other legal personnel to protect the rights of citizens, as well as the conclusions drawn from the investigation by the State Family Planning Commission, the city of Linyi could have, in good faith, offered an explanation and reached a compromise with the public. </seg>
<seg id="28"> When all is said and done, family planning is a difficult problem that is specific to China. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Likewise, we can all empathize with the difficult situation you are in. </seg>
<seg id="30"> But you nevertheless went on to employ outrageous measures--arresting Chen Guangcheng and bringing him back from Beijing to be held prisoner, then attempting to have him found guilty of illegally revealing state secrets. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Don't you find it quite ludicrous to accuse a blind man from a poor mountain village of that crime? </seg>
<seg id="32"> Actually, if you had truly corrected your errors, if you had acted correctly, would you fear the criticism of a blind man? </seg>
<seg id="33"> Did you have to send several dozen people to keep watch over him twenty-four hours a day and, flustered and exasperated, even have him accused of a crime? </seg>
<seg id="34"> On October 4, 2005, Attorney Li Fangping and I arrived in Dong Shigu Village. We put forth a very clear position in the hope of resolving the conflict. </seg>
<seg id="35"> We suggested that we could first talk with your officials to see what thoughts and demands you had. </seg>
<seg id="36"> We took the initiative of suggesting that we could help you persuade Chen Guangcheng that there are some things he should not say. </seg>
<seg id="37"> We hoped that you would not treat a blind person in such a manner. There should be concessions from both sides. </seg>
<seg id="38"> But your decision-makers clung obstinately to their course. Furthermore, you unexpectedly came up with a "careful plan"--beating us and detaining us illegally. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Do you think you can intimidate us in this way? </seg>
<seg id="40"> We haven't done anything illegal, </seg>
<seg id="41"> so we have nothing to fear. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Although the rule of law in China may not be perfect, but neither is it at the point of lawlessness. </seg>
<seg id="43"> If you think you can use thuggish tactics to intimidate us, then you have greatly underestimated our determination and perseverance. </seg>
<seg id="44"> If we want, there are many of us with abundant legal justifications to go to Linyi or visit Chen Guangcheng. </seg>
<seg id="45"> You can beat a lawyer or an academic once, twice, three times, and each time there will be widespread attention and reporting. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Do you really dare to beat us ten times? </seg>
<seg id="47"> Isn't it your official position that you are so worried about? </seg>
<seg id="48"> If the beatings actually result in somebody being injured, will your position be so assured? </seg>
<seg id="49"> You don't listen to our rational advice, but instead resort to low-class ruffian tactics. Don't you find this very foolish and also very dangerous? </seg>
<seg id="50"> I want to make it clear to you that there is a large group of outstanding citizens in China that are devoted to the just adherence to the rule of law. </seg>
<seg id="51"> We are not afraid of ruffian criminal elements. </seg>
<seg id="52"> We will not tolerate the brazen trampling of the lowest limits of human civilization. </seg>
<seg id="53"> If you go too far, we will confidently and calmly step forward, group after group, to welcome your clubs until the moment that you shrink back. </seg>
<seg id="54"> You should understand clearly that the use of hooligan tactics is in no way a good thing for you. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Don't think that after you retreat behind the scenes you will be able to break off your involvement with those local ruffians that beat villagers. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Finally, we also want to remind you that you should treat Chen Guangcheng well. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Blind since childhood, he graduated from collegial studies in Chinese medicine and then taught himself law and English. In the past, he brought legal action against the Beijing Subway Company in order to fight for the rights of blind people and also had running water installed for the villagers. He has become known near and far as "Attorney Chen". </seg>
<seg id="58"> You have unexpectedly mobilized unabashed flunkies to spread rumors and slander him on the Internet and have attempted to have him sentenced with the crime of illegally providing secrets to foreigners. Don't you think that in doing so you have gone too far? </seg>
<seg id="59"> Your house arrest of Chen Guangcheng is illegal. It is also dangerous for you yourself. </seg>
<seg id="60"> At first, you were fully capable of releasing him. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Inasmuch as the savage enforcement of the law had already ceased, he could criticize all he wanted, but how long would he go on? </seg>
<seg id="62"> But you are now steadily denigrating your own image. </seg>
<seg id="63"> Until Cheng Guangcheng obtains his freedom, you will not have a day of peace. </seg>
<seg id="64"> You have persecuted him enough. </seg>
<seg id="65"> If you try to have him convicted of a crime or attempt to use further thuggish tactics, we will not fold our arms and stand by. </seg>

<seg id="3"> With great disappointment, I admit that the Chinese nation does not deserve democracy!!! </seg>
<seg id="4"> Isn't this what the people posting articles here have been doing? </seg>
<seg id="5"> The pity is that there won't be many people (compared to a population of 1.4 billion) coming online to read them. </seg>
<seg id="6"> And there are even fewer people among the web surfers who care about or take part in such topics. I dare say, less than 1% of them! </seg>
<seg id="7"> Let alone the fact that this network is protected by the Golden Shield Project, which is the largest, most complete, most invested and best quality system in the world! </seg>
<seg id="8"> Indeed. </seg>
<seg id="9"> I agonized, despaired, felt helpless and even thought of succumbing. But if we want to lead a life fit for humans, who can we count on to fight but ourselves? </seg>
<seg id="10"> Man proposes and God disposes. Yet even if I failed, I would hold myself to blame and deserve the life of a dog if I did not struggle for my own ideals. </seg>
<seg id="11"> To struggle for something just in itself adds happiness to one's life, at least in terms of one's self-judgment in one's own heart. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Actually, I have absolutely no need to worry about the future of China, </seg>
<seg id="13"> because the global environment is already such that it will not permit the existence of a regime that has failed to hold elections for so long. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It is merely a matter of time. </seg>
<seg id="15"> I just sigh that the Chinese nation could have been so lucky that, at every turn of history, it could always be led by world-class demons onto a marrow-and-blood-sucking road to hell. Some people actually call the heaps of white bones and pools of blood on this road glory and force us to feel proud of such glory. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Although darkness exists everywhere, it is at its longest in China. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Qin Shi Huang and Confucius caused the people to suffer so much. </seg>
<seg id="18"> While Qin Shi Huang persecuted openly, Confucius brainwashed under the table. </seg>
<seg id="19"> It's not that the Chinese do not deserve democracy. It's that they no longer have democracy in their genes, which have all degenerated. </seg>
<seg id="20"> A country with a history of over 3,000 years would have become democratic long ago if its national culture had a component for democracy. </seg>
<seg id="21"> What were the Chinese doing when Athens established its democratic system, when Rome founded the republic, when the British adopted their Charter, when the French issued the Declaration of Human Rights and when the Americans published the Declaration of Independence? </seg>
<seg id="22"> Before Mongolians invaded the Central Plains, they elected their monarch through the Kuraltai. In their early days, Manchurians practiced a democratic system of ministerial meetings. Why did all these fizzle out in the Han regions? </seg>
<seg id="23"> Chinese chase material goods and have no interest whatsoever in spiritual belief and political rights. </seg>
<seg id="24"> You don't believe it? If the Chinese were given universal suffrage, they would sell it to you for a single pie. </seg>

<seg id="3"> Dalai Lama's Envoys Hold Closed Door Talks with Chinese Officials. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Dalai Lama Stressed he Wants Autonomy, Not Independence, for Tibet. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Envoys of Tibet's exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama are in China for closed door talks with Chinese officials. Details have not yet been released. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This is the fifth official meeting since China and the Dalai Lama's exiled government resumed contacts in 2002. </seg>
<seg id="7"> But, as in the past, the two sides are meeting behind closed doors. No details have yet been disclosed. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Reporters say the two sides have held talks on several occasions, but so far there have been no tangible results. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The Dalai Lama, who is in exile in Northern India, says he wants autonomy, not independence, for Tibetã </seg>
<seg id="10"> China has refused to comment on the talks between the two sides. </seg>
<seg id="11"> But analysts say Beijing wants dialogue, partly because it fears the death of the 70-year-old spiritual leader in exile could lead to heightened sentiments among Tibetans unhappy with China rule. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Cultural Identity </seg>
<seg id="13"> The delegation from the Dalai Lama's exiled government is led by Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari. He was also the lead delegate in earlier talks. </seg>
<seg id="14"> A spokesman for the Tibetan government-in-exile said the round of talks that they had with Chinese officials in Switzerland in 2005 were very "intensive and frank" and this has given the Tibetan people hope. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The spokesman said their ultimate hope is to resolve the relevant issues on the basis of a negotiated settlement with the Chinese leadership so that the Tibetan people will have the freedom to preserve what is important to them, which is their cultural identity. </seg>

<seg id="17"> Dalai Lama's Envoy Reiterates Tibetan Independence is Not Being Sought </seg>
<seg id="18"> Dalai Lama to Visit Washington This Month </seg>
<seg id="19"> In the run-up to the Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama's trip to the US on November 8, his envoy has said that the Tibetan government-in-exile is not seeking Tibet's independence. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari said in Washington that he hopes that the Chinese government will truly protect Tibet's unique culture and traditions. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It is expected that during his visit to the US next week the Dalai Lama will discuss the Tibet issue with President Bush in the hope that Bush will press the Chinese government to give Tibet genuine autonomy. </seg>
<seg id="22"> In July of this year, envoys of the Dalai Lama's met with Beijing's officials in Berne for their first direct contact. </seg>
<seg id="23"> "Genuine Autonomy" </seg>
<seg id="24"> Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari said that in recent years talks between the Tibetan government-in-exile and the Chinese authorities has revealed some positive elements. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The envoys of the Dalai Lama found that the leaders in Beijing, particularly the delegates of the CCP's United Front Work Department, are more willing than in the past to listen to their opinions. </seg>
<seg id="26"> But Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari said the Tibetan government-in-exile and the Chinese government still have several differences of opinion and are still far-apart in their standpoints. </seg>
<seg id="27"> He said that in the last five years the Tibetan government-in-exile has done its utmost to respond to China's demands in order to create a favorable negotiating environment. </seg>
<seg id="28"> In order to create a favorable negotiating environment on the Tibetan issue, China should refrain from blindly pressuring the Dalai Lama. </seg>
<seg id="29"> He said the Dalai Lama does not seek independence for Tibet and that Tibet is still a part of China, but that the Chinese government must protect Tibet's unique culture and "allow the Tibetan people genuine autonomy". </seg>
<seg id="30"> Furthermore, Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari said that some Chinese people think that once the Dalai Lama has died the Tibet issue will disappear. </seg>
<seg id="31"> He said that this thinking is extremely dangerous because once the Dalai Lama is dead China will have lost a historic opportunity to solve the Tibet issue. </seg>

<seg id="1"> <HEADLINE> The Key Tools of Democracy: Negotiation and Compromise!(ZT) </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> <POSTER>  Hou Ze </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> I've just read a web friend's posting in "Awe-inspiring Righteousness--Mr. Li Guiren" </seg>
<seg id="4"> His (her) original words were "negotiation and compromise are key tools of democracy. Otherwise, divisions due to differences of opinion result in the failure of democracy!!! It is hoped that idealistic democracy advocates will pay close attention to this point!" </seg>
<seg id="5"> That this prosaic and colorless statement did not attract the interest of any web friends stired a succession of thoughts in my mind and filled me with regret. </seg>
<seg id="6"> I think about China's antiquity. I also think about the past in the west. </seg>
<seg id="7"> I, who have started very few threads, could not resist using a new thread to respond to the posting by the original net friend. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Let's first take a look at antiquity in China. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Everybody knows that in China, starting with the united centralized rule built by Qin Shi Huang, all subsequent dynasties operated according to this political framework. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Although the Han Dynasty temporarily implemented a "dual system"; that is, political system in which feudalism and centralism operated in parallel; it finally ended up employing centralism. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Under the historical conditions of that time, this kind of centralism had facets that were advanced or that promoted productivity and development. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But we should also observe that more than two thousand years of this kind of system resulted in localities that lacked the creativity, initiative and motivation that they should have. Furthermore, it was impossible to tailor-make systems and policies so that they suited local development. </seg>
<seg id="13"> A pyramid-shaped system of political rule also made it so that lower-level officials could only fix their gazes upward and in every regard take orders from their immediate superiors. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Because the local county officials were all appointed by the central government, there was no room for coordination or negotiation between them, let alone with the common people. </seg>
<seg id="15"> When the rights of peasants in ancient China were infringed upon, they could only grin and bear it. </seg>
<seg id="16"> It was only when their most basic rights were threatened, such as by large scale famine, or when their right to life was being deprived due to tyranny or natural calamity, that they would rise in rebellion. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In two thousand years, several turbulent peasant uprisings have swept across the entire country: from the unplanned Chen Sheng and Wu Guang Uprising to the preplanned Yellow Turban Rebellion, and then to the Huang Chao Rebellion in the Tang Dynasty and Li Zicheng, who was able to rule as emperor for a month as the result of an uprising. Besides Zhu Yuanzhang, none of the rebellions obtained a truly meaningful victory. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Even the Ming Dynasty that Zhu Yuanzhang initiated was nothing more than the reincarnation of previous dynasties, with no change in political institutions. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Zhu Yuanzhang, born a commoner and uncultured for the most part, manipulated China's ancient centralized system with a perverse relish, taking it to its extreme limits. The vigor of the Tang Dynasty, characterized by openness, freedom and tolerance, was lost and replaced by a deathly spiritlessness. </seg>
<seg id="20"> All at once, the atmosphere of free speech disappeared from China's vast area. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Human nature was suppressed to the highest degree. </seg>
<seg id="22"> People became timorous, extremely afraid, and unwilling to say too much. </seg>
<seg id="23"> This was the outcome of the only peasant uprising to succeed in two thousand years: in one go it turned the Chinese people into the living dead. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Now let's look at Western Europe's medieval period, which has been called the Dark Ages. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The Middle Ages in Western Europe was a thousand year period that occurred after nomadic peoples destroyed Western Rome and that did not have the slightest connection to ancient Greece and ancient Rome. </seg>
<seg id="26"> This period was characterized by feudalism; that is, the granting of feudal land titles. </seg>
<seg id="27"> As titles were subdivided into increasingly lower strata, the lords at each lower stratum possessed an increased amount of autonomy. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Because they were capable of balancing, restricting and depending on each other both vertically and horizontally, even feudal lords with a few square kilometers of land as well as the dukes, marquises, earls, viscounts and barons that came to power possessed the conditions and clout to win from the king the rights that were rightfully theirs, thereby producing a situation where aristocrats and the king sat together to negotiate for their respective benefit, a situation that has never existed in China. </seg>
<seg id="29"> That is, mutual accommodation and concession, and not the use of violent methods to beat down and replace the other party. </seg>
<seg id="30"> In this way, with the drawing up various agreements, power steadily moved down into the hands of aristocrats and commoners. The power of the aristocrats and commoners gradually increased while the king's power progressively decreased. </seg>
<seg id="31"> By the time the Queen of England came along, she only occupied a passive position and did not have any real power. </seg>
<seg id="32"> This is how democracy was gradually achieved! </seg>
<seg id="33"> Let's take another look back in order to make a comparison. In ancient China, with all power concentrated in the hand of the emperor (with the exception of Li Shimin) and almost no aristocracy, it was almost impossible for peasants to sit with the emperor over a pot of tea or a glass of wine and light-heartedly make mutual compromises and concessions or formulate agreements that satisfied both sides. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Under such circumstances, when they were being deprived of their right to life, they had no choice but to adopt violent methods to overthrow the current dynasty in an attempt to supplant it. </seg>
<seg id="35"> This outcome repeated itself again and again, from the high point of the Tang Dynasty to the morbidity of the Ming Dynasty. </seg>
<seg id="36"> If we compare European and Chinese history, we discover that there is practically no western country with an ancient period where the contradictions between the rulers and the ruled were as sharp as in China. </seg>
<seg id="37"> There is no western country that experienced an endless succession of peasant uprisings like China did. </seg>
<seg id="38"> When contradictions arose between the royal house and the peasants in the ancient history of western countries, the first thing that aristocrats and commoners thought of when they were making an appeal for their own interests was to reach a solution through negotiation and make mutual concessions in order to gradually obtain greater benefits. Rarely did they employ violent methods. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Understanding this, as we enter the 21st century, we can still see on the Internet that there are some democracy militants who, having inherited the ultra-absolute totalitarian thinking of the Ming Dynasty, </seg>
<seg id="40"> and whose bodies have been invaded by the poison of the Cultural Revolution, are incapable as democratic warriors of talking about anything but "overthrow" and "toppling". </seg>
<seg id="41"> But this kind of thinking is the greatest barrier to democracy, because these people do not understand that negotiation and cooperation are the most important means and channel to realizing democracy. </seg>

<seg id="1"> <HEADLINE> Cao Xiaoming--Rich Cultural Activities in the Countryside: Who Will "Pay the Bill"? </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> <POSTER>  Hou Ze </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> During this year's Spring Festival, I was fortunate enough to spend the New Year in the countryside visiting some family and friends. </seg>
<seg id="4"> While being caught up in the rich New Year's atmosphere in China's countryside, I also became worried about the lack of interesting cultural activities in rural areas. </seg>
<seg id="5"> I discovered in a friend's village that in past years the village would set out on its own each Spring Festival to organize the villagers in putting on a local play called "The Galloping Horse Lantern". </seg>
<seg id="6"> The play takes as its subject the characters from the Three Kingdoms. Adults and children can all enact a role in the play. The villagers never tire of watching. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In this way, there are several "Galloping Horse Lantern" performance troupes throughout the county. They perform not only in their own village, but also travel to other villages, with the exchange between villages becoming very lively. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But this year the village did not organize a troupe. </seg>
<seg id="9"> , It seems that it took a lot of money just to buy the costumes for "The Galloping Horse Lantern". In the past, the villagers would each contribute some cash, but now the costumes are tattered to the point that they can no longer be worn. </seg>
<seg id="10"> A house-to-house appeal was made to the villagers to again fork out money, but none was willing. A similar situation has arisen in other villages throughout the county. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Without the "Galloping Horse Lantern", the village has suddenly become cold and cheerless. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The adults have started playing mahjong. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The children have also started playing cards. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The villagers all say that this New Year's was dull. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Other than setting off firecrackers, everybody just played mahjong and that became the general backdrop of Chinese New Year in the countryside. </seg>
<seg id="16"> In addition, repeated bans have failed to halt a gambling craze that is showing a tendency to spread. Games involving upwards of ten thousand yuan have become a common occurrence, with the large number of returning migrant workers playing a particularly important role in many games. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In this way, money earned from a year of hard work is squandered. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Also, family squabbles stemming from gambling sometimes occur. Some even descend into tragedies where families are split or life is lost. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Some farmers say that they gamble not only during the Spring Festival, but also often during the slack season. </seg>
<seg id="20"> If they don't gamble, they don't have anywhere to go. </seg>
<seg id="21"> In the countryside, it is too difficult to organize cultural activities or find entertainment. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Not only is there a lack of facilities and funds, but also nobody volunteers to handle the organization. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In this respect, the method used in Jiangxi is doubtlessly welcome news for rural dwellers. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In order to enrich the cultural life of the rural population, the Jiangxi provincial government has not only implemented as of September last year a program of "government funding, market operation, town construction of stages and villagers watching plays", </seg>
<seg id="25"> but also organizes each year a special fund of at least Rmb60 million for rural cultural projects in order to provide the rural population high quality cultural products. </seg>
<seg id="26"> With the New Year, it added an additional Rmb40 million, making a rural cultural project fund totaling Rmb100 million. </seg>
<seg id="27"> For the rural population, the fruits of this special fund are also very substantial: </seg>
<seg id="28"> They invite various types of professional performance troupes to come to the villages to perform. Each village cannot have less than four performances each year. </seg>
<seg id="29"> They invite screening teams from different levels of movie companies and organizations to come to the villages to show movies. Each administrative village cannot have less than six screenings of entertainment and educational films each year. </seg>
<seg id="30"> They organize and hold popular cultural events that have local character. Each village cannot have less than two or three each year. </seg>
<seg id="31"> From this "purchase list", we can easily see that the government has not thrown money at the problem, but rather has expended a lot of energy to use limited funds in an incisive way in order to deliver a cultural feast with good value to the vast rural population. They have performed an important task. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Now, not an individual among the vast rural population is not ecstatic about the waiver of the grain tax. </seg>
<seg id="33"> If governments could do like Jiangxi and make greater "purchases" to enrich the cultural life of the rural population, it would be another gift from heaven for those living in the countryside, </seg>
<seg id="34"> and this "gift" would not only free the farmers from the mahjong table, the movement in cultural activities would also add another brick in socialist construction of a new countryside. </seg>

<seg id="3"> Kidnap Warning for Wang Peirong's Child Was a False Alarm </seg>
<seg id="4"> After nine o'clock on the evening of January 24, 2006, the child of Wang Peirong finished relating the following: </seg>
<seg id="5"> While making up classes in physics at Xuzhou's No. 3 Middle School on the morning of January 24, 2006, Wang Peirong's child was called out by the entrance guard. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The entrance guard informed Wang Peirong's child that three unidentified men had said the following to the entrance guards of No. 3 Middle School:  Wang Peirong's child, Wang Tianjiao, has not returned home for three days because the father and mother of Wang Peirong's child are not getting along. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Now her mother is missing. We are leaders from her mother's work unit and want to enter No. 3 Middle School to get Wang Peirong's child. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Wang Peirong's child told the entrance guards that what the three men had said was completely untrue and she refused to go with the three men. </seg>
<seg id="9"> With the help of the entrance guards of No. 3 Middle School, Wang Peirong's child was not taken away. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Wang Peirong's child phoned her mother's leader at noon to find out what was going on. The leader denied sending anybody to Xuzhou's No. 3 middle school. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Wang Peirong's child asked her for the phone number of her father's leader. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Wang Peirong's child called her father's leader. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Wang Peirong's child said: Three people came to No. 3 Middle School to take me away. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The leader asked: Why didn't you go with them? </seg>
<seg id="15"> Wang Peirong's child answered: If I had gone with them I would be dead for sure. </seg>
<seg id="16"> When she had finished speaking, Wang Peirong's child hung up the phone. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Hearing a description of the events from his child, Wang Peirong felt that the situation was serious and reported it to the police. </seg>
<seg id="18"> On January 25, the local police station received feedback that the story told by Wang Peirong's child was essentially true. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The police station asked the Kuangda Security Department if they had sent people to the No. 3 Middle School to get Wang Peirong's child. They responded that they hadn't. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The police station again asked the Kuangda Security Department if any of its branch units had sent people to No. 3 Middle School to get Wang Peirong's child. They again answered that they hadn't. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Through them, the relevant departments warned Wang Peirong and his family to pay attention to their safety. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Following the event, the leaders of the relevant departments of Xuzhou municipality paid close attention. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The criminal investigation department of the Xuzhou Public Security Bureau excluded the possibility of a kidnap attempt against the child. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Wang Peirong thanked the relevant department heads of the Xuzhou municipality and the criminal investigation department of Xuzhou Public Security Department. </seg>
<seg id="25"> It was a false alarm. The main cause of the false alarm was possibly the entrance guards of No. 3 Middle School. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The criminal investigation department of the Xuzhou Public Security Bureau has learned: On January 24, the leader of the College of Science, which is Wang Peirong's work unit, and three other individuals urgently needed to find Wang Peirong (Wang Peirong still does not know why they were looking for him) and could not find him  by telephone. They thought of going to No. 3 Middle School to find the teacher of Wang Peirong's child in order to ask if Wang Peirong's child was still in Xuzhou. </seg>
<seg id="27"> A weighty topic: Why is the risk involved in corruption relatively low while the cost of fighting corruption is high? </seg>
<seg id="28"> http://bbs.people.com.cn/bbs/ReadFile?whichfile=44796&typeid=39 </seg>
<seg id="29"> Under the present cadre system and anti-corruption system, what corrupt officials need to be worry about is a few relevant officials overseeing them, not the broad masses of people. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Therefore, once they feel that they have successfully hoodwinked or contented those few officials that can determine their fate, they can they feel reassured and unafraid as they carry out their great project of corruptly and illegally collecting wealth while disregarding the feelings of the nearby masses of people. </seg>
<seg id="31"> On the contrary, if the common people who don't hold any power come across an injustice and stand up against corruption, they will possibly provoke an extremely brutal reprisal, </seg>
<seg id="32"> or be branded by the government and end up at any time being crushed in defeat before obtaining any victory. </seg>
<seg id="33"> A comparison of the two: engaging in corruption is relatively risk free, while the cost of resisting corruption on the other hand is high. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Now let's take a look at the Iranian nuclear issue. </seg>
<seg id="2"> The International Atomic Energy Agency verified on the 6th that the Iranian government had sent a letter to the International Atomic Energy Agency demanding that it dismantle and remove all equipment monitoring Iran's nuclear facilities by the middle of this month. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Because the International Atomic Energy Agency decided to report the Iran nuclear issue to the United Nations Security Council, Iran has announced the termination of all support and cooperation measures it had adopted with respect to the nuclear issue, and it will not longer permit the International Atomic Energy Agency to perform surprise inspections of its nuclear facilities. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Targeting the current tense situation with respect to the Iranian nuclear issue, Russian foreign minister Lavrov said on the 6th in Athens that the cooperation between Russia and Iran still exists. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This will become the driving force in the resolution of the Iran nuclear issue. </seg>
<seg id="6"> On the same day, a spokesperson for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that Russia's proposal to Iran to establish a joint uranium enrichment enterprise within Russia's borders was still effective. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The two parties could engage in negotiations concerning this issue next week. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On the same day, at United Nations headquarters in New York, Senator Lugar, chairman of the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that the United States does not approve of Israeli attacks of Iran's nuclear facilities. </seg>
<seg id="9"> According to recent reports, Israeli defense experts have said that, if necessary, Israel could severely damage Iran's nuclear facilities. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Xinhua News Agency reports that on the 7th, Russian deputy foreign minister Kislyak said Russia is willing to cooperate with Iran regarding the nuclear issue and help Iran obtain the legal authority to peacefully develop nuclear energy. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Kislyak said that Russia's proposal to Iran to establish a joint uranium enrichment enterprise with Iran remains valid. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Russia hopes to hold negotiations with Iran concerning this issue in the near future. </seg>
<seg id="13"> At the end of December last year, Russia submitted a proposal to Iran that the two countries establish a joint uranium enrichment enterprise within Russia's borders. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The European Union and the United States both said that they could accept this compromise proposal. </seg>
<seg id="15"> But Iran hopes Russia will continue to revise the original plan. </seg>
<seg id="16"> On the 7th, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Kong Quan said that although the International Atomic Energy Agency had reported the Iran atomic energy problem to the United Nations Security Council, it had not transferred the agency's responsibility to handle the Iranian nuclear issue to the Security Council. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Therefore, the various parties must still break the deadlock over the Iran nuclear issue within the framework of the International Atomic Energy Agency. </seg>
<seg id="18"> According to a resolution of the International Atomic Energy Agency, International Atomic Energy Agency General Director Baradei will deliver a report concerning the Iran nuclear issue to the Security Council in March. </seg>
<seg id="19"> After evaluating this report, the Security Council will make a final decision. </seg>
<seg id="20"> We feel that this resolution mentions requiring Iran to, uh, fulfill the relevant Security Council resolutions and the promises it has made, and has not submitted or transferred this problem to the Security Council. </seg>
<seg id="21"> For some time recently, China has sought a peaceful resolution to the Iran nuclear issue through diplomatic means. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Kong Quan said that on February 1, Zhang Yan, Director-General of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Department of Arms Control and Disarmament, held talks in Tehran concerning the Iran nuclear issue with Lalijiani, negotiating representative of the Secretariat of the Supreme Security Council of Iran. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The Chinese hope Iran will attach importance to the international community as the key to creating conditions for a peaceful resolution of the Iranian nuclear issue. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Resolution of the Iranian nuclear issue within the IAEA framework is not only in China's interests; moreover, we firmly believe that it is in the interests of all parties. </seg>
<seg id="25"> To this end, we once again call on the concerned parties in the international community to not abandon the diplomatic efforts made regarding this issue. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Hamas, which is currently in the process of forming the new Palestinian self-rule government, has announced that, with the exception of the prime minister, the nominees for the new government's cabinet are essentially in place. </seg>
<seg id="2"> This has triggered all manner of speculation among outsiders concerning the selection of the prime minister. </seg>
<seg id="3"> On the 8th, a senior Hamas official disclosed to the Associated Press that Hamas was prepared to nominate ((businessman)) Khudari, chairman of the board of trustees of Islamic University in Gaza, but this nomination has yet to be formally submitted to Abbas. </seg>
<seg id="4"> With the support of Hamas, Khudari, who is now 51, participated in Palestine's parliamentary election last month as an independent candidate. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Khudari has never mentioned violence or opposition to Israel in his public speeches. </seg>
<seg id="6"> But he has said that Palestine must engage in internal reform. </seg>
<seg id="7"> A high-level Hamas delegation is currently visiting Cairo to discuss the issue of Hamas' formation of the new Palestinian Authority government. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On the 8th, Khaled Masha'al, a member of the delegation, told the press that despite the constant pressure from the international community and certain Arab countries, the Palestinian government formed by Hamas leaders would not recognize Israel. </seg>
<seg id="9"> At the same time, Masha'al warned Abbas in his statement: do not arbitrarily change the structure of Palestinian leadership without consulting Hamas in advance. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Analysts believe that this was in response to Abbas' plan to appoint interior minister Yousef as deputy commander of security forces. </seg>
<seg id="11"> And concerning the issue of the formation of a new Palestinian self-rule government, Masha'al declined to verify the news that Hamas was preparing to nominate ((businessman)) Khudari, chairman of the board of trustees of Islamic University in Gaza to serve as the prime minister. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Masha'al said, "The nominee for prime minister has yet to be determined." </seg>
<seg id="13"> Prior to Masha'al's reiteration of the refusal to recognize Israel, in an Egyptian television interview, Ma'erzuke, another Hamas political leader, said, "Hamas will absolutely not recognize the legal status of Israel, but the new government will continue have contacts with Israel in a variety of areas. Because whether or not one recognizes Israel and whether or not one has dealings with it are two different matters." </seg>
<seg id="14"> Setting aside the new animosity and old grudges toward Israel of the three Hamas nominees for prime minister, territorial issues have always been a sticking point in Palestinian-Israeli relations. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In an interview with Israeli television channel 2 on the 7th, Ehud Olmert, acting prime minister of Israel, said that Israel must be separated from Palestine through the delineation of a permanent border. </seg>
<seg id="16"> This implies that Israel will have no choice but to withdraw from some of the territory on the west bank of the Jordan River. </seg>
<seg id="17"> However, Olmert stressed that Israel will continue to control large Jewish settlements on the west bank of the Jordan and the Jordan River Valley area, and will preserve the integrity of Jerusalem. </seg>

<seg id="1"> All right, welcome everyone to the Chinese news program. </seg>
<seg id="2"> China's consulate in Karachi verified on the 15th that three Chinese engineers and one Pakistani driver were attacked and killed in Balochistan in southwestern Pakistan. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Upon learning of the matter late last night, Chinese president Hu Jintao expressed a high degree of concern for the safety of Chinese engineers and technicians in Pakistan. </seg>
<seg id="4"> He directed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Chinese embassy in Pakistan to demand that the Pakistani authorities apprehend the perpetrators and ensure the safety of Chinese personnel in Pakistan, and to handle the final affairs of the deceased appropriately. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Hu Jintao also expressed deep grief for the personnel who were killed and his sincere condolences to the families of the victims. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In the early morning hours today, following president Hu Jintao's instructions, foreign minister Li Zhaoxing spoke with Kasuri, Pakistan's minister of foreign affairs. </seg>
<seg id="7"> China's embassy in Pakistan immediately activated emergency mechanisms, and concerned personnel have already rushed to the scene. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Premier Wen Jiabao also issued instructions with respect to ensuring the safety of Chinese personnel, handling the final affairs of the deceased and demanding that Pakistan apprehend the assailants. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Additionally, according to the latest news from the Chinese consulate in Karachi, the bodies of these three Chinese were already moved to Karachi early this morning, and will be shipped back to China by special airplane within the next several days. </seg>
<seg id="10"> After the attack, the Chinese consulate in Karachi quickly dispatched a three-person team to the scene of the incident, and the bodies of the three Chinese engineers were moved to a hospital in Karachi for storage. </seg>
<seg id="11"> At the same time, a dozen or so Chinese personnel who work at the same work site as these people have been withdrawn to Karachi, and their emotions are now stable. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The attack occurred in a town called Hub in southeastern Gawadar. </seg>
<seg id="13"> That afternoon, six Chinese engineers who worked at a local cement factory boarded a van and were about to return from the worksite to their residence when they were intercepted by an unidentified hoodlum riding a motorcycle. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The hoodlum fired a submachine gun, and three of the engineers were killed. </seg>
<seg id="15"> After the attack, a tribal paramilitary organization called the "Balochistan Liberation Army" claimed responsibility for it. </seg>
<seg id="16"> That night, Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement strongly condemning the attack, and claimed that it was an act of terrorism. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The three Chinese who were killed were Long Hongbao, Wei Jianping and Zhao Bin, technical personnel from the Hefei Cement Industry Design Institute, a subsidiary of China National Building Material Group Corporation. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Qin Gang said today that national leaders in China were highly concerned about the attack on Chinese engineering and technical personnel in Pakistan, and were demanding that Pakistan ensure the safety of Chinese personnel in Pakistan and apprehend the assailants as quickly as possible. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Qin Gang said that China's ambassador to Pakistan, Zhang Chunxiang, had reported the relevant situation to Pakistani state and military leaders, and had formally taken up the matter with them. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Pakistan strongly condemned this barbaric and savage incident, expressed grief over the unfortunate deaths of the Chinese employees, and said that they would do everything possible to apprehend the assailants, cooperating fully with Chinese authorities to handle the matter. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The Ministry of Foreign affairs is coordinating with the concerned departments to arrange for the bodies of the deceased to be returned to China as quickly as possible. </seg>
<seg id="22"> A team to handle the final affairs formed by the unit that dispatched the deceased, Hefei Cement Industry Design Institute, a subsidiary of China National Building Materials Group Corporation, left Beijing for Pakistan this morning. </seg>
<seg id="23"> After the incident occurred, the Ministry of Commerce also established an emergency response team. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Assistant Minister of Commerce Chen Jian said that if safe operations could not be guaranteed for the time being, work could not begin on the cement factory construction project. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Only when the safety of construction personnel could be guaranteed would work continue. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The bodies of the three Chinese engineers who died in an attack in Pakistan began their journey from Karachi back to China on a special Pakistani air force flight at 7:00 a.m. local time this morning. </seg>
<seg id="2"> Let's watch the report filed by our correspondent in Pakistan, Tao Ye. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The bodies of the three Chinese engineers killed near Karachi on the 15th began their journey back to China from Karachi's Faisal air force base on the morning of the 17th. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The atmosphere at Karachi's Faisal air force base in the first rays of the morning sun was very solemn. </seg>
<seg id="5"> China's ambassador to Pakistan, Zhang Chunxiang, the director of the internal affairs department of Sind province, where Karachi is located, and China's consul general to Pakistan, Sun Chunye, led Chinese consular personnel in Pakistan and employees from Chinese companies to give their departed compatriots a final sendoff. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Led by ambassador Zhang Chunxiang, all of the people on site bowed three times in front of the three caskets. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Then, soldiers from the Pakistani honor guard slowly moved the caskets onto the special plane provided by the Pakistani air force. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Chinese and Pakistani personnel at the site made a circle around the airplane, then watched as their departed Chinese compatriots left. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The plane took off from the air field at around 7:20 a.m. </seg>
<seg id="10"> This plane will make a brief stop in the Pakistan capital of Islamabad. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Senior Pakistani government officials will board this, uh, this special flight, which will fly from Islamabad to Hefei, China on the same day. </seg>
<seg id="12"> This plane ((is projected)) is projected to arrive in Hefei, China this evening, Beijing time. </seg>
<seg id="13"> It is anticipated that the special plane transporting the bodies of the three victims will arrive in Hefei at around 10:00 this evening. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Now let's connect with our reporter at the Hefei Luoguang Airport, Li Guangyu. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Hello Li Guangyu, give us a report on the situation at your end. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Greetings, anchor. </seg>
<seg id="17"> We remain unclear as to the specific time that the plane from there will land at the airport here. </seg>
<seg id="18"> What we do know now is that at 5:30 this afternoon, that plane from Pakistan landed at the Urumqi airport, and they were transferred to another plane from Urumqi to Hefei. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Arrival is estimated at around 11 or 12 o'clock tonight. </seg>
<seg id="20"> As to the specific kind of ceremony to take place when the bodies arrive tonight, and what people will appear, uh, we are still not very clear. </seg>
<seg id="21"> So, we now know that this afternoon, the provincial government and, uh, relevant personnel from the, uh, cement design institute have held some coordination meetings, uh, to coordinate some of the content for tonight. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Uh, now, their work unit, uh, in the last two days, the chairman of the labor union of the cement institute over here, uh, has established a consolation team, which has continually been doing consolation work in the homes of the victims. </seg>
<seg id="23"> As for the specific compensation figure, we still have no definite, certain answer. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Uh, we do know that one of the insurance items is 400,000 in accidental injury insurance. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Uh, the families have yet to contact insurance companies directly concerning claims; rather, the work unit has stepped forward to make inquiries with the claims processing company and the, uh, insurance company concerning the processing of claims. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Uh, this is the situation as I understand it at present. </seg>
<seg id="27"> All right, thank you, Li Guangyu, for your onsite report. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Additionally, Yuan Fengning, Xue Jijun and Yang Wei, who were fortunate to survive the terrorist attack on February 15, and other personnel from the Hefei Cement Research and Design Institute who were stationed in Balochistan, Pakistan, returned by plane to Hefei. </seg>
<seg id="29"> When the plane carrying the three survivors and the eleven other employees arrived in Hefei, the people waiting at the airport breathed a sigh of relief. </seg>
<seg id="30"> I feel that being able to return safely, I feel very relieved. </seg>
<seg id="31"> And our country is very (()) to attach importance to this matter. </seg>
<seg id="32"> After the incident occurred, the appropriate relocation of them. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Now they are  to be delivered safely home. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Officials from Anhui province and the China Building Materials Group came to the airport to meet the plane, and to convey greetings and appreciation to the eleven employees. </seg>
<seg id="35"> They expressed deep grief for our comrades killed in the abrupt incident in Pakistan. </seg>
<seg id="36"> And they expressed an enthusiastic welcome to the other eleven comrades who were able to return to their motherland safely today. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Concerned parties explained that claims processing for the three victims and consolation of their families were in process. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Though the bodies of the three murdered Chinese engineers have returned to their mother country, the investigation into the attack continues in Pakistan. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Just one hour ago, at twelve o'clock Beijing time, Pakistani police met with Chinese consular staff in Pakistan and reported the progress of the investigation to the Chinese. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Now let's connect with our correspondent in Pakistan, Tao Ye. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Hello, Tao Ye. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Hey, hello. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="44"> In the meeting just now, through-- </seg>
<seg id="45"> (()) </seg>
<seg id="46"> In the information meeting just now, what progress in the investigation was reported? </seg>
<seg id="47"> Ah, all right. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Just as you've said, only an hour ago, the chief of police in Balochistan, the province where the place where the incident occurred is located, by the name of Yakubu, came to China's consulate general in Karachi to report on the investigation into this affair by Pakistani police in the last two days to China's ambassador and consul general. </seg>
<seg id="49"> In his report, he briefly introduced the current clues and objectives of the, uh, Pakistani police in pursuing the primary culprits. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Uh, they firmly believe that this matter was done by outsiders, but they are certain that they had contacts with some local residents. </seg>
<seg id="51"> So, they are now focusing on, uh, uh, certain employees who had employment relationships with the company where the Chinese engineers worked. </seg>
<seg id="52"> They believe these people could have provided, uh, some clues, provided some intelligence for the culprits, intelligence including, for example, what time the Chinese engineers departed and what time they arrived in what places. </seg>
<seg id="53"> They may have also provided cover for these culprits. </seg>
<seg id="54"> So these, uh, aspects are the focus of the current police investigation. </seg>
<seg id="55"> According to this chief of police, he said that after two days of investigations, they had interrogated over fifty people. </seg>
<seg id="56"> The scope of this investigation is currently shrinking. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Also, um, when the Chinese information meeting ended, this chief of police and his police officers also, also went into the mourning hall set up in the Karachi consulate general to pay their respects to the, uh, three deceased. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Uh, additionally, um, another thing that was relatively interesting was that a Balochistan Liberation Army that had always claimed to exist in the past (()) responsibility for this matter, but this news has yet to be verified by Pakistani officials. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Uh, when answering the questions of this station's reporter concerning this matter, that chief of police said that this, uh, terrorist organization in fact is a very loose terrorist group with no definite integral organization. </seg>
<seg id="60"> So, uh, he many many people claim to be members of this organization. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Uh, therefore, uh, from the Pakistani perspective, they, uh, are still laying the focus of the investigation on many specific individuals. </seg>
<seg id="62"> As for this organization, they do not view it as a major key, uh, uh, aspect. </seg>
<seg id="63"> All right. </seg>
<seg id="64"> All right, Tao Ye. </seg>
<seg id="65"> (()) </seg>
<seg id="66"> Mm, we will continue to keep an eye on the related investigation situation. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Danish prime minister Rasmussen held a press conference at the Prime Minister's Office on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="2"> He said, "The incident of the cartoons of Islam founder Mohammed has developed to the current state where extremists are exploiting it." </seg>
<seg id="3"> He ((claimed)) that Denmark respects all beliefs, and he appealed that everyone has the same rights, uh, while also calling on Muslims to exercise restraint and not resort to violence. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Danish prime minister Rasmussen and the foreign minister held a press conference in the Prime Minister's Office at 4:30 p.m. on the 7th. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Rasmussen said. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The incidents of violence that have occurred at the embassies of these European countries are not merely a matter between Muslim countries and Denmark. </seg>
<seg id="7"> It is extremely important to the Danish government and the Danish people to obtain the broad support of the international community to pass through this difficulty. </seg>
<seg id="8"> We have formed an alliance with France. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Some organizations and institutions in Muslim countries belonging to other European countries and the United States are cooperating closely. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Several minutes ago, U.S. president Bush telephoned. </seg>
<seg id="11"> During the telephone conversation, he expressed support for Denmark and consensus with Denmark. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Rasmussen said, "We also feel that the matter will be resolved through dialogue and tolerance, not violence." </seg>
<seg id="13"> We emphasize that freedom and democracy and respect for beliefs are treasured values. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Today we call on the people in all Muslim countries to cooperate to end the expansion of the violence. </seg>
<seg id="15"> We must resolve the matter through dialogue, not violence. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Today we are facing an expanded international situation. </seg>
<seg id="17"> We have seen the burning of the Danish flag and the destruction of its embassies. </seg>
<seg id="18"> We see Danish people being seen as intolerant people, being seen as enemies of Islam. </seg>
<seg id="19"> This is wrong. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Extremists and radicals are exploiting cultural conflict to expand the situation. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Rasmussen emphasized, "Denmark and we Danes are not the enemies of Islam or other religions." </seg>
<seg id="22"> For many generations has Denmark transcended politics in pursuit of human rights, democracy and freedom. </seg>
<seg id="23"> We continue to struggle for this. </seg>
<seg id="24"> This is part of Denmark's history, and is an essential component of Danish society. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Denmark is one of the most tolerant and open countries in the world. </seg>
<seg id="26"> We respect all beliefs. </seg>
<seg id="27"> We resist violence. </seg>
<seg id="28"> We believe that everyone has equal rights. </seg>
<seg id="29"> New Tang Dynasty reporters Li Luo and Dan Ni, reporting from Copenhagen, Denmark. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Iranian extremists dissatisfied with the publication of cartoons of Mohammed once again charged the Danish embassy in Tehran on Tuesday, lobbing Molotov cocktails at it. </seg>
<seg id="31"> At the same time, in revenge, a state newspaper in Iran sponsored a contest of cartoons depicting the Nazi slaughter of Jews. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The United States condemned this move as an arrogant means of intensifying Iranian president Ahmadinejad's persistent anti-Israeli sentiment. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Approximately 20 to 30 protesters climbed over the wall into the courtyard of Denmark's embassy in Iran. </seg>
<seg id="34"> And more than 300 people outside the embassy threw rocks and Molotov cocktails at the building. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The previous day, student members of an Iranian hardline paramilitary organization led hundreds of protesters in an attack on the embassies of Denmark and Austria in Tehran. </seg>
<seg id="36"> The cartoons that triggered the dispute were first published last September by Denmark's Jyllands-Posten. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Other European countries and three Arabic newspapers also carried them subsequently. </seg>
<seg id="38"> In retaliation, Hamshahri, Iran's most widely distributed newspaper, recently announced that it was sponsoring a contest of cartoons depicting the Nazi slaughter of the Jews. </seg>
<seg id="39"> This move was sharply denounced by the United States and other countries. </seg>
<seg id="40"> United States Department of State spokesperson McCormack said that this move by Iran's best-selling Hamshahri was in order to strengthen the virulent anti-Israeli sentiment espoused by president Ahmadinejad. </seg>
<seg id="41"> McCormack reiterated that the United States supports freedom of speech everywhere throughout the world, including Iran. </seg>
<seg id="42"> But he believes that Hamshahri's cartoon contest and the cartoons of Mohammed published in the Danish media are two entirely separate matters. </seg>
<seg id="43"> McCormack said, "I do not believe anyone would mention freedom of the press in Iran and freedom of the press in western Europe and the United States in the same breath." </seg>
<seg id="44"> Ahmadinejad once said that the slaughter of the Jews was a fiction, and called for Israel to be wiped off the map, attracting broad criticism from the United States and other countries. </seg>
<seg id="45"> McCormack believes that Hamshahri is owned and published by the conservative municipal government of Tehran. </seg>
<seg id="46"> The current sponsorship of the cartoon contest is by no means coincidental. </seg>

<seg id="2"> They also said they would continue to announce the signatures and number of participants in the second batch. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Please watch the following report filed by this station. </seg>
<seg id="4"> According to reports, as the result of intentional profiteering activities on the part of the government, Shanghai housing prices are now ranked among the highest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Many government units have come up with ways to force demolition and relocation of residents in residential housing in highly priced areas without offering reasonable compensation. </seg>
<seg id="6"> These people, who have suffered the painful loss of their homes under forced demolition and removal, have been left immediately with no income to rely on. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Children unable to pay tuition dare not attend school. </seg>
<seg id="8"> For many years, the vast majority of people who have appealed such matters have been rewarded with time in labor reeducation. </seg>
<seg id="9"> According to statistical data, Shanghai is the region with the largest number of people petitioning for assistance in China. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Han Zhongming originally owned a shop, but when faced with forced demolition and removal, his private residence was also resold at an exorbitant price. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Because he petitioned to higher authorities for assistance, authorities placed him under house arrest and even detained him. </seg>
<seg id="12"> He jumped from a building and cut his wrists in protest, and was only released recently. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Chen Enjuan's store also met with government peremptory demolition and removal. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The government hired thugs to drag her and her other two family members outside, then a tractor shovel was used to eradicate her house, furniture and all. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Because she appealed for help, she underwent nearly two years of labor reeducation. </seg>
<seg id="16"> When Chen Enjuan spoke of this solidarity hunger strike activity, in addition to protesting the government's thug-like conduct. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Attorney Gao has offered us much assistance with respect to legal matters, he has helped us very selflessly. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Our defense of our rights now is a demand for democracy, ah, because we are considering the next generation. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The generation that preceded us already suffered enough; we are fighting so that the next generation will not be oppressed. Therefore, we must participate in that rights defense activity. We cannot abandon it. </seg>

<seg id="24"> The 24-hour hunger strike activity initiated by attorney Gao Zhisheng in ten provinces and cities throughout China beginning February 14 is in protest of the tyrannical rule of the Chinese Communists. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Legislative Councilor Leung Kwok-hung, who has expressed support for attorney Gao Zhisheng's hunger strike movement, said that the Chinese Communists' unrestrained arrest of defenders of rights in recent days is already an extremely dangerous signal that this regime has absolutely no basis in popular will. </seg>
<seg id="26"> That same day was the time of the one-day weekly hunger strike by Legislative Councilor Albert Ho, who is in the process of setting up a human rights defender watch group. </seg>
<seg id="27"> He said that on this day this week, he would introduce the work of a human rights defense lawyer from inside China to the outside world. </seg>
<seg id="28"> He was also certain that such human rights defense movements would continue. </seg>
<seg id="29"> On February 13 in Calgary, Canada, employees of the Epoch Times and Falungong practitioners held a joint press conference outside the Chinese consulate, expressing support for the domestic and foreign relay hunger strike initiated by attorney Gao Zhisheng, and opposing the acts of violence against American Falungong practitioner Li Yuan by Chinese Communist agents, and called on the government of Canada and all just-minded people inside and outside China to watch with concern and support human rights defense activities in China. </seg>
<seg id="30"> This is Warner Village Square, a busy shopping district in Taipei. </seg>

<seg id="42"> Over 40 people concerned about Chinese democracy and liberty came from Delaware, Philadelphia, South Jersey and New York to participate in the global human rights defense relay hunger strike press conference in front of the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia, condemning the armed Chinese Communist agents who beat up Epoch Times Chief Technology Officer Li Yuan in broad daylight, and expressing solidarity with the act of justice initiated by Gao Zhisheng in China. </seg>

<seg id="2"> Due to concerns that the Maoist insurrections that have taken place in increasing number and intensity over the last several months could penetrate the border, three new battalions have been added to Sashastra Seema Bal, which is responsible for guarding the 200-kilometer India-Nepal border in Darjeeling County. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Nepal faces the Himalaya mountains to the north. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On its other three sides, it borders on India, with which it shares a border totaling 1,477 kilometers in length. </seg>

<seg id="15"> After price adjustments, in the quarter from October through December, experienced real growth of 1.4 percent over the previous quarter; the growth rate exceeded the anticipated rate of 17.2 percent. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The primary reasons were strong domestic demand and signs of continuing economic recovery exhibited by export growth to major countries such as China and the United States. </seg>
<seg id="17"> This is Japan's fourth consecutive quarter exhibiting economic growth, and is the greatest rate since the first through third quarters of 2005, primarily aided by personal spending, capital expenditures and stable exports. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Additionally, in April, Japan's central bank will also end its extremely lax monetary policy of the last five years. This has encouraged financial market expectations for the economy. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Private sector consumption from October through December rose 0.8% percent under the effects of slight improvements in the unemployment rate and wages. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The Nikkei index rose after the announcement of the gross domestic product data, but by the end of the morning session, it had fallen 0.74 points. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Immediately following the International Atomic Energy Agency's decision to hand the Iran nuclear issue over to the United Nations Security Council, Iran reiterated that there is no room for negotiations with the United States, one of the proponents. </seg>
<seg id="2"> Uh, an Iranian government spokesperson said on Monday that the policy toward the United States implemented to date has been not to discuss or negotiate its relationship with the opposing party. </seg>
<seg id="3"> He said that it was a major mistake for the west to hand the nuclear issue over to the Security Council, demonstrating the west's obstruction of Iran's development. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On Sunday, Iran said that it was suspending cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, and would resume uranium extraction and enrichment and prohibit surprise inspections of nuclear facilities. </seg>
<seg id="5"> So with respect to this issue, Iran's current attitude is relatively unyielding, and the attitude of the United States is even more unyielding. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Uh, American secretary of defense Rumsfeld has already reasserted multiple times that the use of military force has not been ruled out with respect to this problem. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Uh, now it is rumored that the U.S. military is really in the process of implementing such a plan. </seg>
<seg id="8"> They are developing a kind of superhuge bomb called the mother of bombs. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Uh, once the Defense Department orders it, they will use this superhuge, uh, bomb to bomb Iran. </seg>
<seg id="10"> So how big a bomb is this mother of bombs? </seg>
<seg id="11"> According to reports, just in terms of weight, it is 30,000 pounds, equivalent to a double decker bus, and, uh, it is also extremely large in volume. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Uh, the development of such a super bomb is primarily in order to bomb certain, uh, underground facilities in Iran. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Because of its extremely strong penetration force--it can pass through concrete as well as steel plates--it is likely to create a large pit equivalent to 60 meters long half a mile, destroying many such, uh, underground structures and facilities. </seg>
<seg id="14"> So now it appears that the United States has truly begun provisionally polishing its guns or provisionally making bombs. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Regarding this issue, Rumsfeld says that no means have been ruled out to resolve the Iran nuclear issue, and military means had already been placed on the table. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Also, the Iran nuclear issue is continually upgrading, so, uh, when interviewed by this station, a concerned Iranian official stationed in Washington said that in fact, Iran continued to uphold the adoption of peaceful negotiations to cooperate with international society, and, uh, they hoped to alleviate the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="17"> But he also said that Iran would adjust the contents of its nuclear project in cooperation with Russia. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Regarding the second round of negotiations between Iran and Russia concerning the uranium enrichment project, Iran said that the negotiations would proceed as originally planned, but it emphasized that the changes occurring in the current situation made it necessary to make some adjustments to the content of negotiations. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Previously, Russia had always expressed support for Iran's peaceful use of nuclear power, and it had expressed that it would insist on not submitting the Iran nuclear issue to the Security Council. </seg>
<seg id="20"> However, now we see that they have already approved the submission of the Iran nuclear issue to the U.N. Security Council. </seg>
<seg id="21"> With this new situation, we therefore may make some changes to the policies arrived at previously with Russia. </seg>
<seg id="22"> And, prior to the U.N. Security Council's final decision as to whether or not to adopt economic and political sanctions in March, Iran has advocated continuous negotiations with international agencies, and it is willing to cooperate with the international community, thereby alleviating the current crisis. </seg>
<seg id="23"> We emphasize, in order to fight for our own economic development and national construction, Iran will not relinquish the right to peaceful use of nuclear energy. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Iran has not violated relevant international laws. We hope that the United States can also understand this. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The Iran nuclear issue is completely different from the problems in Afghanistan and Iraq. </seg>
<seg id="26"> I think the United States is also very clear on this point. </seg>
<seg id="27"> As for so-called military attacks, we have not seen any clear statement of position from the United States. </seg>
<seg id="28"> We do not wish to see the crisis escalate further. </seg>
<seg id="29"> We also emphasize that we want to use peaceful negotiating methods, but we will not submit to pressure. </seg>

<seg id="1"> First, let's look at today's headlines. </seg>
<seg id="2"> The northeastern states and Atlantic coast region of the United States were blasted by the first blizzard of the winter this morning. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Accumulations exceeded 60 centimeters in some areas. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Many airports were forced to shut down. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Over 2,000 flights were canceled. </seg>
<seg id="6"> And this was the first snowfall of this magnitude in New York City's history. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Uh, this was the second highest snowfall record in history. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Let's have a look at the specifics. </seg>
<seg id="9"> On Sunday morning, New York residents woke up to find themselves in a world of white. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Most buildings and streets outside were covered in a thick layer of accumulated snow. </seg>
<seg id="11"> New York's Central Park recorded a snowfall of 57.9 centimeters. </seg>
<seg id="12"> This is the second highest snowfall record in New York City's history. </seg>
<seg id="13"> New York's Mayor Bloomberg said this was a frightening blizzard. </seg>
<seg id="14"> For the sake of safety, he urged people to stay at home and not go out. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The storm forced the cancellation of most flights at New York City's three airports. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Some of them were only be able to resume on Monday. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The snow flew in Washington as well, where snowfall exceeded 50 centimeters. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Lawns and tree trunks were enrobed in white. </seg>
<seg id="19"> But President Bush still went to church, as is his custom. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Many city residents left their homes to appreciate the wintry landscape and took the opportunity to play in the snow. </seg>
<seg id="21"> United States Weather Service radars showed snowfalls occurring universally from eastern Virginia all the way up to Maine. </seg>
<seg id="22"> In New Jersey, New York's Long Island, Connecticut and Maryland, residential and commercial electricity was also interrupted after the blizzard. </seg>
<seg id="23"> It was estimated that over 150,000 customers were without power. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Meanwhile, in Europe, a broad area was also affected by snowstorms. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The southern German state of Bavaria mobilized several thousand firefighters and soldiers, who, together with police and volunteers, cleaned accumulated snow from rooftops and roads. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The Deggendorf area in eastern Bavaria remained in a state of emergency after several days of major snowfall. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Some villages had already lost contact with the outside world. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Pressure from accumulated snow caused a roof to cave in last month in Bad Reichenhall, Bavaria, resulting in 15 deaths. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Phoenix Satellite News Roundup. </seg>
<seg id="30"> In the blizzard that blasted the northeastern United States, New York was of course one of the cities affected. </seg>
<seg id="31"> For the local situation, we are about to connect to this station's New York correspondent, Luo Xiaoying. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Hello, Xiaoying. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Hello, Xiaonan. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Hey. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Experiencing such a large snowstorm here, what exactly is the situation like? </seg>
<seg id="36"> We've heard that there are even power outages in some areas, is it true? </seg>
<seg id="37"> And what places have been affected? </seg>
<seg id="38"> It's really true. </seg>
<seg id="39"> In fact, the, uh, area covered by this blizzard is quite broad. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Then I am very happy to report, we have finally seen the snow stop. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Although this blizzard came on ferociously, there have been no reports of major casualties. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Several states in the eastern United States coverage area have been affected, such as Maryland, with 21 inches of accumulation, Pennsylvania with 19 inches, and New York and New Jersey with accumulations in excess of 24 inches. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Snowflakes could be seen from Virginia to Maine, and even in Tennessee. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Then, well, uh, as you just said, uh, it resulted in power outages in many areas in the Washington area and Baltimore. </seg>
<seg id="45"> The total number of households without power is probably over 100,000. </seg>
<seg id="46"> New York City is better off, as to power outages in, uh, New York City's Manhattan, the power supply situation is normal. Only in Long Island are there some outages. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Rhode Island has declared a state of emergency. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Only emergency vehicles such as snowplows and ambulances are permitted to pass on roads. </seg>
<seg id="49"> As to traffic and transportation, a little while ago, uh, the three major airports in the New York area were closed. </seg>
<seg id="50"> But, uh, as twilight approached, we discovered that, like, certain activities to resume airport operations had begun appearing at Newark Airport in New Jersey and LaGuardia Airport in New York. </seg>
<seg id="51"> So some people estimate that these airports will open later, uh, in several hours. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Like Delta Airlines, Delta Airlines has announced that all flights in Washington, as well as Philadelphia, Baltimore and Connecticut have been grounded until Monday. </seg>
<seg id="53"> At present, Reagan Airport in Washington, DC is already open. </seg>
<seg id="54"> At present, buses have suspended operation in the New York and New Jersey region. </seg>
<seg id="55"> And scheduled bus and train service has been reduced. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Now we are at, uh, it is currently Sunday in New York, still the Lantern Festival. </seg>
<seg id="57"> To us Chinese, the Lantern Festival, originally, some local Chinese communities had Lantern Festival activities, but they were forced to cancel them. </seg>
<seg id="58"> As to the people of New York, generally speaking, their Sunday activities were also canceled. Uh, not many people are going out, they are all staying at home. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="60"> What's troubling everyone now is what to do about work on Monday? </seg>
<seg id="61"> Uh, snow removal and, uh, accumulated snow could result in some flooding. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Therefore, the governments of these, uh, affected areas in the United States are studying how to face the floods of people and cars going to work on Monday. </seg>
<seg id="63"> Xiaonan. </seg>
<seg id="64"> All right. </seg>
<seg id="65"> Thank you, Xiaoying, for giving us the latest report from the United States. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Since there's nothing to be done about it, one might as well rest easy and appreciate this, uh, very beautiful snowscape. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Let's have a look at several news items concerning Japan. </seg>
<seg id="2"> Er, Koizumi has always wanted to upgrade Japan's Defense Agency to a ministry, in order to increase Japan's military strength. </seg>
<seg id="3"> But great controversy has been stirred up during this process, which has met with one snag after another. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Recently, scandals have arisen when Japan's Defense Facilities Administration Agency, which is subordinate to the Defense Agency, placed requests for bids, uh, requests for construction bids, resulting in arrests by authorities of certain current and former officials. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Therefore, many people have recommended that Koizumi exercise caution in the process of upgrading the agency to a ministry. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Well, recently, Koizumi said that he was temporarily shelving this plan, that for the time being he would not be submitting it to the Diet for deliberation. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Uh, he also hopes that the two ruling parites are able to discuss this issue carefully in order to, er, continue exchanging views. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In other news, if you go to Japan, there is now a new requirement. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Japan plans to require the majority of tourists and travelers visiting Japan to be fingerprinted and photographed. </seg>
<seg id="10"> It is doing so in order to prevent certain unsafe elements from entering Japan. It is also intended to prevent, uh, illegal immigration. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Er, so now, it should be a little more difficult to go to Japan. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Well, of course, Japan also had a bit of happy news recently. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Princess Kiko of Japan is expecting. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This matter has made many Japanese naturally hope that she will bear a son to succeed to the throne. </seg>
<seg id="15"> However, she has also made waves in the imperial household, which has always been relatively calm. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Uh, in fact, Kiko of course is now a later-age expectant mother, and everyone always thought she was satisfied with her family of four. </seg>
<seg id="17"> With her becoming pregnant again at this age, many people could not help but guess that, uh, a struggle for the throne could be playing out between the brothers of the royal family. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Of course, many people are delighted to talk about this conspiracy theory. </seg>
<seg id="19"> To explain this matter may require going back several years. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Uh, it was like this: at the time, in '02, because Crown Prince Naruhito, uh, his wife, became depressed, the royal family did not hold out much hope for them at the time, so they turned to exerting pressure on Prince Akishino. </seg>
<seg id="21"> At that time, there was not much response from Akishino. </seg>
<seg id="22"> But by 2004, the contradiction intensified somewhat, because Naruhito, eager to protect his wife, blamed the royal family in public. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Well, according to reports, the royal family was infuriated, and demanded that Prince Akishino, who is of the same generation, step forward to make a rebuttal, saying that his elder brother had been disrespectful to the royal family, and was doting on his wife. </seg>
<seg id="24"> From then on, there has been discord between the brothers. </seg>
<seg id="25"> So now, if, uh, Prince Akishino bears a son, then their, uh, main axis will become a pillar of the, uh, royal family. </seg>
<seg id="26"> And that will assuredly cause a decline of the eastern palace, that is, the crown prince. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Uh, so a good many people believe that if this happens, it will have a great impact on the royal family and Japanese society. </seg>

<seg id="1"> United Nations Secretary General Annan went to the White House Monday to meet with American president Bush. </seg>
<seg id="2"> Regarding Iran's announced postponement of nuclear negotiations with Russia, Annan urged Iran to cease nuclear activities as quickly as possible, and to resolve problems through negotiations rather than confrontation. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Another news item indicates that the U.S. Department of Defense has already begun plans for intensive bombing of Iran, to serve as the ultimate backup plan if diplomatic efforts fail. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Originally, outsiders thought that Bush and Annan would discuss the possibility of UN Security Council sanctions against Iran, but the two did not announce discussions in this regard after their meeting. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Bush and Annan both emphasized that they hoped the Iranian nuclear issue would be resolved through negotiations. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Annan expressed concerns over Iran's commencement of uranium enrichment activities and its decision to postpone nuclear negotiations with Russia. </seg>
<seg id="7"> On the same day, the U.S. media reported that military strategists at the Pentagon had already begun intensive planning of military actions to be adopted with respect to Iran; in the event that diplomatic efforts fail, the U.S. will use military means to halt Iran's development of nuclear weapons. </seg>
<seg id="8"> According to reports, the commander of the U.S. Central Command is in the process of determining attack targets. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Attack methods could include submarine-launched ballistic missles and air strikes by B-2 bombers. </seg>
<seg id="10"> On Monday, Annan called on all parties not to adopt actions that would escalate the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="11"> According to analysis by military experts, Iran could have the ability to produce nuclear weapons within two years. </seg>
<seg id="12"> And there are still more than two years remaining in Bush's second term. </seg>
<seg id="13"> He will strive to resolve the Iran nuclear issue during his term, whether by peaceful or military means. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Mo Naiqian, Phoenix Satellite News, reporting from Washington. </seg>
<seg id="15"> On the 13th, Iranian president Ahmadinejad said superpowers that threaten other countries with their own weapons were about to disappear. </seg>
<seg id="16"> While commemorating the 27th anniversary of the Islamic revolution, Ahmadinejad met with diplomatic envoys of various countries. </seg>
<seg id="17"> He said that the arms contests and competitions in the scramble for hegemony among various countries in the world would not yield results. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The appetites of superpowers can never be satisfied. They even threaten other countries with their weapons. </seg>
<seg id="19"> But he said these superpowers who rely on weapons to threaten other countries would disappear. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The day when mankind enjoys permanent peace and stability is about to arrive. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Thus it can be seen that this is now not merely, um, a war of words, but really and truly, um, this kind of saber rattling between Iran and the western world and America is now getting worse and worse. </seg>
<seg id="22"> So, because the, uh, attitudes between Iraq and the United States are mutually unyielding, recently, the situation has changed somewhat; the day before yesterday, Iran formally announced that it was resuming its plans to extract and enrich uranium. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In fact, some western diplomats surmised that they may very well have actually resumed certain processes in uranium extraction and enrichment prior to this. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Additionally, Iran announced that it was postponing negotiations with Russia indefinitely; the negotiations concerned Russia extracting and enriching uranium instead of Iran. </seg>
<seg id="25"> So of course the indefinite postponement of this negotiation plan was also determined with respect to the current, new situation. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Uh, recently, because the United States, uh, has continued its threats to attack Iran, a U.K. think tank, the Oxford Institute, has issued a report. </seg>
<seg id="27"> If the United States actually adopts military force, it will result in the death of half of the people, and of course it will trigger, uh, the possible continuation of this year's, uh, wave of violence in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Also, some, uh, terrorist attacks will also worsen. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Of course, oil prices will also rise sharply. This is also among the, uh, this series of domino effects. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Moreover, the report also says that if the United States is unable to make Iran submit, it will certainly accelerate Iran's determination to produce nuclear weapons itself. </seg>
<seg id="31"> So, we have just mentioned the issue of negotiations between Russia and Iran. </seg>
<seg id="32"> An Iranian government spokesperson indeed indicated on Monday that due to the emergence of the new situation, the negotiations with Russian officials concerning the extraction and enrichment of uranium inside Russia originally set for the 16th would be postponed. </seg>
<seg id="33"> A Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson said that they had not received formal notification from Iran. </seg>
<seg id="34"> So it is currently still too early to say whether the meeting will go on. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Additionally, on Monday, uh, the head of Russia's Federal International Atomic Energy Agency, Guqinuofu, said that the Russians had already prepared the conditions and principles for negotiations with Iran concerning the nuclear issue. </seg>

<seg id="1"> At the same time, the New York Times of the United States recently published an editorial. </seg>
<seg id="2"> And the title of this editorial was extremely striking: Japan's offensive foreign minister. </seg>
<seg id="3"> So, this editorial, uh, specifically mentions that Taro Aso, the Japanese foreign minister, has made a series of astonishing statements recently. </seg>
<seg id="4"> These statements are all extremely dishonest, extremely unwise, and these statements have been met with the universal indignation of Asian countries. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Well, uh, the editorial also specifically mentions that Japan, uh, should acknowledge its own mistakes and assimilate lessons, unlike what it is doing now--post-war educational materials avoiding mention of the things they did during the war. </seg>
<seg id="6"> At the same time, this editorial also says that many of Taro Aso's current statements, such as demanding that the, uh, prime minister visit the Yasukuni Shrine, such as, uh, colonial rule over Taiwan raised, ah, uh, Japan's colonial rule raised the education level of Taiwan, etc.--it astonishes people when he makes such statements, and, very clearly, he has no knowledge of history, and his diplomacy skills are terrible. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Well, the New York Times had the third largest distribution in the United States last year, so it should be very influential in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Therefore, this editorial should also be very influential. </seg>
<seg id="9"> At the same time, a seminar was held recently by certain former high officials of the U.S. government and certain experts specializing in the study of Asian affairs--a seminar on Sino-Japanese relations. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Well, some experts raised the following viewpoint at the seminar. </seg>
<seg id="11"> They said that Sino-Japanese relations are currently in a period of extreme tension, and that there is a potential risk of military conflict. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Moreover, they even said that the possibility that a military conflict could erupt between China and Japan was higher than the possibility that a military conflict could erupt across the Taiwan Strait. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Er, and once a military conflict erupts, the United States is certain to be dragged in, because the U.S. would certainly become involved. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Well, a spokesperson for Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs who also participated in the seminar said that Sino-Japanese relations are indeed in an extremely tense phase at present. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Um, any mistakes could result in severe consequences. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Additionally, the defense and security committee of Georgia's parliament held an extended session and decided to expel, uh, the Russian peacekeeping forces in the South Ossetia region. </seg>
<seg id="17"> A general meeting of the Russian parliament will convene today for deliberations on this proposal. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Er, experts believe that if the parliament approves the expulsion of Russian peacekeeping forces, it could result in a complete rupture in relations between Georgia and Russia. </seg>
<seg id="19"> On the 14th, a spokesperson for the Russian peacekeeping forces said that two of the Russian peacekeeping force's military vehicles transporting food were intercepted by Georgian police, and that the drivers had been run off. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Er, the spokesperson then demanded that Georgian authorites immediately cease such provocative activity, otherwise Russia would not accept responsibility for the consequences of the incident. </seg>
<seg id="21"> On Monday evening, two military vehicles belonging to the Russian peacekeeping force logistics system that were transporting grain and non-staple foodstuffs encountered an inspection by Georgian police in the South Ossetia region. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The Georgian police officers on duty ran the Russian drivers and escort personnel off and took the two vehicles by force and drove off in them. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The incident raised resentment among the Russian peacekeeping force. </seg>
<seg id="24"> A spokesperson for the Russian peacekeeping forces claims that on February 1, Georgian police detained a Russian military vehicle in the same area, giving a traffic accident as the reason, and have yet to return the vehicle. </seg>
<seg id="25"> On February 8, they detained three Russian officers for two days and nights under the pretext of visa problems. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Georgia's intentional acts of provocation are in the hopes that a sanguinary incident will occur in the region, forcing Russian troops to open fire, in order to achieve the objective of withdrawal of the peacekeeping forces. </seg>
<seg id="27"> On the same day, the Russian embassy in Georgia took up the matter formally with Georgian authorities, demanding that Georgia cease such frenzied provocation immediately, otherwise Russia would not assume responsibility for the consequences of resulting conflicts. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Media indicated that on February 13th, Georgian defense minister Irakli Okruashivili announced that leaders of the Russian military base in Akhalkalaki had sold several guided missiles used by the "Arrow" type portable guided missile system to South Ossetia. </seg>
<seg id="29"> On the same day, the Georgian parliament's national defense and security committee held an extended session, heard reports from force ministries, and decided to expel Russian peacekeeping forces stationed within Georgia's borders, requesting deliberation of this issue at the general meeting of parliament on the 14th. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Experts believe that once the final decision passes, it could lead to a final and total rupture in relations between Georgia and Russia. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Prior to this, Georgian foreign minister Gela Bezhuashvili harshly criticized the Russian position and rejected Russian president Vladimir Putin's statement that if the west acknowledged Kosovo, Russia could acknowledge Abkhazia and South Ossetia, believing that Russia was sending a signal of encouragement to all separatist regions. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also claimed previously that it will protect Russian citizens in South Ossetia, implying the threat of direct military force against Georgia. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Admiral Gary Roughead, commander in chief of the United States Pacific Fleet, announced Tuesday that the U.S. will be dispatching four aircraft carriers to the Asia-Pacific region this summer to conduct the largest-scale military exercises in ten years. </seg>
<seg id="2"> Roughead also said that the United States would, er, not, uh, view China, um, as a threat. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The U.S. military hopes to be able to conduct another round of joint exercises with China's People's Liberation Army. </seg>
<seg id="4"> This statement of position immediately attracted the concern of American defense experts. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The Heritage Foundation, an American think tank, held a seminar Wednesday concerning the Pentagon's defense evaluation report. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The delicate relationship between the defense report and the military exercises became one of the focal points of the discussion. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Some feel that Roughead's public invitation to China to participate in the military exercises is a good will gesture toward China on the part of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="8"> At the same time that it invited China to participate in the military exercises, the U.S. also mentioned its hope that the operations of China's People's Liberation Army would become more transparent. Some defense experts therefore believe this demonstrates that the Pentagon is puzzled by China's intentions to expand its military, and hopes to use joint military exercises to  engage in mutual probing and exploration. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Additionally, because the defense evaluation report issued by the Pentagon earlier this month views China as the greatest future potential threat, two defense experts have also indicated that Asia-Pacific military exercises are the U.S. Defense Department's first step toward adjusting its strategy based on this. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Xie Xiaoshuang, Phoenix Satellite News, reporting from Washington. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Also, much attention is being focused on, uh, the American military exercises this summer, because this is the first time in ten years, ah, that the U.S. has had four, uh, aircraft carriers jointly participate in one military exercise, and, uh, it is the first time since the, uh, Vietnam War, that the U.S. has moved aircraft carriers from the east coast to the, uh, western Pacific region to conduct such military exercises. </seg>
<seg id="12"> So these military exercises are in fact quite close together--there will be four of them over several months. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Er, included among them will be one military exercise involving more than one country. </seg>
<seg id="14"> So this multinational military exercise will include Japan, uh, Korea and Australia. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Now a look at today's headlines. </seg>
<seg id="2"> On the 15th, Chinese engineers and technical personnel were attacked by gunmen in the southern Pakistan province of Balochistan. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Three engineers from Hefei in Anhui province were killed, as was their Pakistani driver. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Local police described this incident as a blatant terrorist attack. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The Chinese consulate general in Karachi has already taken up the matter with the local government, handled related matters arising from the incident, and demanded that the Pakistani authorities apprehend the assailants. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This group of Chinese engineers worked at a local concrete factory. </seg>
<seg id="7"> On the 15th, on a road in the small town of Hub, about fifteen kilometers from Karachi, the largest city in Pakistan, they encountered a gunman sitting on the back of motorcycle who opened fire. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Two of them died on the spot, while the other was seriously wounded and died later. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Their Pakistani driver was also killed. </seg>
<seg id="10"> All three came from Hefei in Anhui province. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The other three Chinese with them in the vehicle fortunately escaped with their lives, and were uninjured. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The Chinese consulate general in Karachi said it attached a high degree of importance to this incident. </seg>
<seg id="13"> After the incident occurred, we immediately dispatched our top level counselor and consular officials to the worksite where the incident occurred to assist in handling related matters arising from the incident. </seg>
<seg id="14"> We have now relocated all of the remaining eleven engineers and technicians from this worksite to Karachi. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Additionally, the bodies of the three compatriots who were killed have been transported to a hospital in Karachi for preservation. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Er, so, it should be said that after the incident occurred, we immediately took the matter up with the government of Pakistan, and strongly condemned this attack targeting Chinese nationals. </seg>
<seg id="17"> We are currently demanding that the Pakistan authorities, ah, do everything in their power to solve the case, and severely, uh, punish the assailants severely. </seg>
<seg id="18"> We have demanded that Pakistan adopt realistic security measures to ensure the personal and property safety of Chinese personnel and project teams in Pakistan. </seg>
<seg id="19"> After the incident, a local armed organization called the Balochistan Liberation Army claimed responsibility for the attack, and said that they killed Chinese engineering personnel because they had joined hands with the government of Pakistan to plunder the mineral resources of local tribal residents. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Balochistan provincial police described the incident as a blatant terrorist attack in which a gunman killed innocent Chinese nationals. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement promising to strengthen security measures with respect other Chinese engineering personnel, and to intensify efforts to arrest the murderers in the attack. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Phoenix Satellite News Roundup. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Additionally, Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on the evening of the 15th strongly condemning the shootings of the three Chinese engineers that afternoon, calling the incident a terrorist act. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The statement said,"The government and people of Pakistan strongly condemn the shootings of the Chinese engineers. </seg>
<seg id="25"> "The government and people of Pakistan express deep respect for the Chinese engineers who have given their lives for the sake of Pakistan's development. </seg>
<seg id="26"> "The government and people of Pakistan express their sincere condolences to the families of the deceased." </seg>
<seg id="27"> The statement said, "The government of Pakistan is determined to strenghten protections for Chinese citizens working in Pakistan. </seg>
<seg id="28"> "The government will adopt all measures to prevent the occurrence of similar incidents in the future." </seg>
<seg id="29"> The statement also said, "The shooting of the three Chinese engineers was a terrorist act intended to create a (()) in Pakistani-Chinese relations. </seg>
<seg id="30"> "The government of Pakistan will not permit such attempts to succeed. </seg>
<seg id="31"> "Pakistani law enforcement authorities are in the process of adopting steps to apprehend the assailants and bring them to justice in a rapid fashion." </seg>
<seg id="32"> Additionally, late in the evening of the 15th, Chinese president Hu Jintao learned of the shootings of the Chinese engineers and technicians in Balochistan, Pakistan, resulting in three deaths. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Er, after hearing this news, he expressed a high degree of concern for the safety of Chinese engineers and technicians in Pakistan. </seg>
<seg id="34"> So Hu Jintao, uh, he immediately directed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Chinese embassy in Pakistan to demand that Pakistan apprehend the assailants and ensure the, uh, safety of Chinese personnel in Pakistan, and, er, to handle the final affairs of the deceased appropriately. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Additionally, Hu Jintao also expressed deep grief for the Chinese personnel who were killed, and conveyed sincere condolences to the families of the deceased. </seg>
<seg id="36"> All right, let's contact Chen Yiming, Islamabad correspondent for the People's Daily, right away to get the latest news on this issue. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Hello, Mr. Chen. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Give us an overview of the latest progress in the investigation of the shootings of the Chinese engineers. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Er, right, anchor. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Er, as I understand it from the Chinese consulate general in Karachi, um, er, China's, uh, consulate general has, uh, already informed the, uh, unit where the deceased worked of this unfortunate incident. </seg>
<seg id="41"> So, according to, uh, convention, um, the, er, final arrangements for the final affairs of the deceased should be made by their work unit, er, in consultation with, um, the families. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Additionally, Pakistan's, uh, Ministry of Foreign Affairs also issued a statement yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="43"> His, er, the statement indicated that, um, the, uh, instigators of this incident, er, intended to sow discord in relations between China and Pakistan. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Er, the statement indicated, uh, that they would conduct a thorough investigation of this incident, and, er, would, uh, strengthen security guard work with respect to all, uh, Chinese working in, um, this country, and it indicated that Pakistan would do its utmost to prevent the recurrence of similar incidents. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Er, in addition, according to a report from Pakistan's privately-run GEO on the evening of the 15th, in an interview with that station that evening, Baber Bashir, the chief executive officer of Pakistan's Attock Cement Factory, indicated that after the occurrence of this attack, Pakistan, er, would arrange, um, for the remaining eleven Chinese engineers and technicians working on this project to return to their countries, ah, as quickly as possible. </seg>
<seg id="46"> In the interview, this Bashir also said that concerning, ah, the doubts raised by some Pakistani media about why, er, when the incident occurred, the Chinese engineers were not accompanied by security personnel, er,  he said, uh, in fact, the factory where these engineers worked has its own security system, but because the location where the incident occurred was still within the scope of the factory area, there were no security personnel accompanying them when the incident occurred. </seg>
<seg id="47"> So, he expressed great regret at the occurrence of such an unfortunate incident. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Anchor. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Yes, all right. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Er, also, this was not the first time that Chinese engineers were attacked and killed in Pakistan. </seg>
<seg id="51"> One previous instance of such an incident occurred in October '04. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Two Chinese engineers were kidnapped by an armed organization in South Waziristan. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Ultimately, one of them lost his life during the rescue operation. </seg>
<seg id="54"> And another was in May of the same year, when three engineers died in a bombing attack in Gwadar. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Let's take a look back for a moment. </seg>
<seg id="56"> On May 3, '04, in the port of Gwadar in the southern part of Pakistan's Balochistan province, a van carrying twelve Chinese nationals encountered a car bombing attack on its way to a worksite at the harbor. </seg>
<seg id="57"> The result: three Chinese engineers died, and nine were injured. </seg>
<seg id="58"> It is believed that this attack was initiated by local separatists and tribal militias. </seg>
<seg id="59"> On October 9 of the same year, two Chinese engineers were kidnapped by gunmen in the South Waziristan region along the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="60"> During an attempt to rescue the hostages by Pakistani forces soon thereafter, one of the engineers was unfortunately shot and killed. </seg>
<seg id="61"> However, this hostage incident is believed to have been perpetrated by an armed organization related to a jihadist organization, not by the separatist militia. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Because China has a close economic relationship with Pakistan, and is participating in the construction of Pakistan's infrastructure, a good many Chinese engineering personnel work there. </seg>
<seg id="63"> And Pakistan has tribal militia organizations accusing the government of plundering their natural resources. </seg>
<seg id="64"> This has resulted in multiple instances of Chinese people becoming the victims of attacks and kidnappings. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Let's look at several news stories from Japan. </seg>
<seg id="2"> Recently there was this bit of relatively shocking news from Japan's world of politics. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Which was that Tsuneo Watanabe, the, um, chairman of Japanese media giant Yomiuri Shimbun, ordered, uh, Yomiuri Shimbun to publish some articles opposing Koizumi's visit to the Yasukuni Shrine, and Yomiuri Shimbun's, um, position since then has, uh, been in opposition to Koizumi's visit. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Uh, so, in a speech several days ago, this Tsuneo Watanabe, uh, he criticized Koizumi severely, saying that he was extremely ignorant and lacked any historical or cultural knowledge. </seg>
<seg id="5"> At the same time, he also said that a visit by Koizumi to the Yasukuni Shrine would be like paying tribute to Hitler, and he said that by doing so, Koizumi would cause China and Korea to view Japan as an extremely dangerous country, and this would be a constant source of trouble in the future. </seg>
<seg id="6"> So why would this attitude of Tsuneo Watanabe's cause such a great commotion? </seg>
<seg id="7"> In fact, he is very influential in political circles, and has always been a controlling character behind the scenes. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And he, uh, was a person who was far to the right in the past. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It should be said that he has always supported the hawk faction, and he has worked hard to promote amendment of the constitution. </seg>
<seg id="10"> But, uh, now, he has truly made a major about face. </seg>
<seg id="11"> He has turned the muzzle of his gun and begun shooting at Koizumi, adopting an attitude of opposition. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Actually, when people attacked Koizumi for visiting the Yasukuni Shrine in 2004, this Tsuneo Watanabe still said, uh, he said he supported it, and he wanted Koizumi to resist the pressure. </seg>
<seg id="13"> But in a recent talk, he said, "I'm already over eighty years old, I don't have much time left." </seg>
<seg id="14"> So now, he comes out in lofty tones, speaking out with a sort of very anti-war attitude. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The effect of this, um, change of sides on his part on Japanese society as a whole naturally remains great. </seg>
<seg id="16"> For example, concerning himself, he said, "I firmly believe I have this kind of assurance and the ability to change political trends." </seg>
<seg id="17"> He also said that if Yomiuri Shimbun received government pressure in the areas of free speech and editorial freedom, he would resist it with his life. </seg>
<seg id="18"> So what kind of situation has taken shape now? </seg>
<seg id="19"> Japan's biggest newspaper, Yomiuri Shimbun, and Japan's second biggest newspaper, the super Asahi Shimbun, have begun to join hands in opposition to Koizumi's Yasukuni Shrine visits. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Originally, these two major papers were at odds with each other, but after the two chairmen met, they at least reached a consensus on this issue. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Thus now, both of them have adopted major offensives to, uh, criticize Koizumi. They can be said to be a dream team. </seg>
<seg id="22"> In fact, these two major newspapers should still have, uh, enormous influence on mainstream public opinion in Japan. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Also, let's take a look at the current legislative session in Japan. At a recent meeting, two of the more popular candidates to succeed Japanese prime minister Junichiro Koizumi both said the same thing. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Who are these two? </seg>
<seg id="25"> Yes, one is Chief Cabinet Secretary Shinzo Abe, and the other is Japanese Foreign Minister Tari Aso, who has repeatedly made astonishing statements recently. </seg>
<seg id="26"> What did the two of them say? </seg>
<seg id="27"> They said that Japan's, uh, World War II war criminals were not criminals. </seg>
<seg id="28"> What they meant was, uh, it was the international court that called them, um, criminals, and convicted them of crimes. </seg>
<seg id="29"> But domestically in Japan, based on international law, based on Japan's domestic laws, they, the war criminals, had not violated Japan's domestic laws. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Therefore, they believe that Japan should not view the World War II war criminals as criminals. </seg>
<seg id="31"> At the same time, this Shinzo Abe also mentioned that Japan should now turn its eyes to the world at large, develop its relationship with the United States, develop its trade relationships with certain southeast Asian countries, and do its utmost to develop a close relationship with India, and not always focus on China. </seg>

<seg id="1"> <HEADLINE> Hope but No Assurance for Championship </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> <POSTER> Love life love Luneng </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> The battle field of China's Soccer Superbowl will soon see warã </seg>
<seg id="4"> The Luneng Taishan (of Shandong Province) soccer team is getting ready for the next season, preparing to make another advance for the championship. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Three strong teams, Dalian, Luneng, and Shanghai, will fight for the championship </seg>
<seg id="6"> In the end, who will be the champion? </seg>
<seg id="7"> According to analysis of their strength, although the Luneng team has great hope of winning the championship, it does not have 100% assurance. </seg>
<seg id="8"> First of all, the new players only have a short time to train and be broken in. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Last year Luneng came home empty from the four big games. </seg>
<seg id="10"> This year Luneng has brought in two famous national players, Li Leilei and Wang Liang, and soon there will be two foreign players that will join the ranks as well.  The team's power can be said to have had increases and no decreases. </seg>
<seg id="11"> However, because the national team must prepare for competitions with Pakistan and Iraq, the national players won't be able to practice with their team mates. </seg>
<seg id="12"> When they finally return to their club, the tournament will begin shortly; </seg>
<seg id="13"> thus the breaking in and integration of new players is the biggest problem faced by Luneng. </seg>
<seg id="14"> I think that in the first few rounds of the tournament they should let the national players play second string. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Firstly they can use the competitions to break in and integrate the ranks, </seg>
<seg id="16"> and secondly they can allow these players who played in two national group competitions to rest a bit. </seg>
<seg id="17"> After a few rounds, when the 'knives' are broken in, it will not be too late for them to come into play. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Also, the team has hidden trouble with its defense. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In the past, Luneng's defense has been denounced by fans, </seg>
<seg id="20"> This year, with the addition of Li Leilei, the team's defense has improved but is far from being foolproof. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The problem of middle rear guards being slow at turning around the ball still exists, and second string players are either too old or lack experience. </seg>
<seg id="22"> If middle rear guards are stable in their abilities this year, then another step will be taken toward Luneng's road to the championship. </seg>
<seg id="23"> I believe that the team should use Ren Yongshun, whose physical condition is good.  Although he lacks experience, he can train this year, and prepare for the present and future. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Besides this, Gao Yao is good at playing both forward and rear positions . </seg>
<seg id="25"> Luneng has many players that can play center field, Cui Peng and Hai Bin can play this position. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Gao Yao's body is strong, he's good at stealing the ball, and in the position of middle rear guard he should be able to do a good job. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Once again, if the foreign players will be suitable or not is a problem. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Foreign players are a big problem that has always complicated Luneng. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Last year, the unleashing of Ionel Danciulescu left many unimpressed, </seg>
<seg id="30"> and selections for this year's foreign players have still not been made. </seg>
<seg id="31"> I think that this year, besides bringing in a extraordinary forward, they should also bring in a pure left forward guard, </seg>
<seg id="32"> Except for Xing Rui from several years ago, Luneng doesn't have a left footer in the true meaning. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Although Cui Peng and other can live up to the position, a true left forward guard would be much better than guest players. </seg>
<seg id="34"> If these three problems are resolved, Luneng's road to gain the championship should be more even. </seg>
<seg id="35"> As a Luneng fan, I hope that Luneng wins the championship this year, </seg>
<seg id="36"> However, to tell the truth, the shape of this year's championship has Luneng with great hopes but no great assurances. </seg>

<seg id="3"> Hello everybody, </seg>
<seg id="4"> Spring festival has once again run past us just like that, and those friends who put their vacation time and their Spring Festival holiday break together are one by one returning to their jobs. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Wishing all friends a happy New Year, if I say happy New Year now it doesn't count as too late. </seg>
<seg id="6"> One day I was chatting with NPLCN in a cafe, and he talked about today's BrandVista. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The website is much more beautiful, </seg>
<seg id="8"> the placement of content isn't bad, </seg>
<seg id="9"> and what he liked most was the community BBS based on Discuz, which is now getting a comprehensive update. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Mentioning the community, I must thank a certain person, </seg>
<seg id="11"> that is the General Manager of the Discuz Beijing Company, Mr. Li Mingshun. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Doing a search on Google with his name, you'll get many results; </seg>
<seg id="13"> you probably know that before he was at Sina, he established a business himself, making a small- and medium-enterprise Internet advertisement exchange platform similar to the foreign adbrite.com. </seg>
<seg id="14"> At that time I argued with him on MSN that his main meaning was: Vista thinks the development of many of China's industries relies on the strengthening of the private economy and small and medium industries, </seg>
<seg id="15"> and currently in the Chinese market, this situation does not allow people to be optimistic; </seg>
<seg id="16"> thus creative industries and similar consultative agencies in service of small and medium enterprises have no way to take shape in any scope, </seg>
<seg id="17"> and demand a relatively high fee to facilitate self development, finally leading to a recurring cycle that is not encouraging. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Later he came to Discuz. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Discuz is a truly outstanding community program based on the PHP and MySQL databases; </seg>
<seg id="20"> with the help of Beijing technical engineer Ramboo, the BrandVista community finally saw light once again, and came into the market in full force. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Feedback has been very good, </seg>
<seg id="22"> the user interface is clean and friendly, </seg>
<seg id="23"> the speed is fast; </seg>
<seg id="24"> under a spotlessly clean user interface, writing a little text that leaves me inspired and others enlightened, and exchanging every little fact about life and work with friends and coworkers with the same pursuits, I began to believe that this is a kind of joy. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Thank you Discuz! </seg>
<seg id="26"> News in the advertisement industry of late is rather substantial. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Beginning in January, the WTO's opening up of institutions related to the advertisement industry will begin to be implemented. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Major foreigners have already arrived one after another, and lesser foreigners are sharpening their knives; it seems to be a scene of prosperity. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The problems of Batey Ads of Singapore are rather numerous; </seg>
<seg id="30"> under the circumstances of consecutively losing several heavyweight customers, and seeing setback after setback on the mainland, Sir Martin finally took a little time from the Italian lawsuit to think about shuffling his cards. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Batey Ads merged with JWT.com, keeping its brand name, but managed by JWT. </seg>
<seg id="32"> At the same time, there are also rumors saying Bates and 141 net will soon merge into the Ogilvy system, with management being carried out by Ogilvy Advertising; </seg>
<seg id="33"> although before this, 141 already reported to Ogilvy; allowing Bates to report to Ogilvy is also an interesting matter. </seg>
<seg id="34"> During Spring Festival, the website had many articles updated; I won't tell of all of them here; </seg>
<seg id="35"> if everybody has time, you can get onto the website and look at them. </seg>
<seg id="36"> At the same time, for those friends who have not yet entered the new forums, there is no hindrance for you to click your mouse a little more, and then you can enter BrandVista's totally new community. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Feel the environment, experience the atmosphere, contribute some writing. </seg>
<seg id="38"> I hope you are able to feel and find the happiness of our organization </seg>
<seg id="39"> Wishing that all friends are in a wonderful mood. </seg>

<seg id="3"> Look at this article, and share it; </seg>
<seg id="4"> this is not an impulse on thought, instead it is warm goodness long held in one's heart. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Ask yourself if it were you, what would you have done; </seg>
<seg id="6"> the answer is very clear, I would have put down the telephone saying, "wrong number." </seg>
<seg id="7"> This year I have been thinking about when all is said and done, what actually counts as helping people. </seg>
<seg id="8"> I have already abandoned all behaviors like donating money and donating items. </seg>

<seg id="10"> Wishing you a day of happiness : ) </seg>
<seg id="11"> Helen </seg>
<seg id="12"> Mother of Ten Years Ago </seg>
<seg id="13"> It was one day ten years ago when this teacher was using the noon rest time to sleep at her home; suddenly the telephone rang. </seg>
<seg id="14"> She received the call and listened, and out came a strange and rough sound: "your child was stealing books and now she's been caught by us, come quickly!" </seg>
<seg id="15"> From out of the receiver also came the noise of a young girl crying, and the sounds of chiding from people surrounding the young girl. </seg>
<seg id="16"> She looked over at her only daughter who was watching TV, and she immediately understood. </seg>
<seg id="17"> It was definitely a young girl who was caught by the salesperson stealing books, but was not willing to allow her family to learn of this; thus, she made up a phone number, and by coincidence it rung at the teacher's home. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Of course the teacher could put down the phone and take no notice of this -- she could even rebuke the person on the receiving end, </seg>
<seg id="19"> because this event had no connection to her whatsoever. </seg>
<seg id="20"> But she was a teacher, and maybe the girl was her student </seg>
<seg id="21"> through the telephone, she could vaguely imagine that the little girl who had a momentary lapse in judgment with serious consequences must be extremely nervous and scared; she was facing perhaps the most frightening circumstances ever in her life. </seg>
<seg id="22"> After hesitating for a moment the teacher suddenly thought of an idea -- yes, she'd just do it. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Therefore, after she got the address of the bookstore, she immediately went there. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Just as she expected, in the bookstore stood a little girl with a face full of tears, </seg>
<seg id="25"> and the adults around her were fiercely chiding her. </seg>
<seg id="26"> She rushed up at once, hugging that poor little girl and turning to the salesperson by her side, saying, "talk to me about this, don't frighten the child." </seg>
<seg id="27"> While the salesperson grumbled that he was not willing, she handed over a fine of several tens of RMB before taking this little girl out of the bookstore and getting a clear look at a face in a complete mess with tears and panic. </seg>
<seg id="28"> She began smiling and took the little girl to her home, cleaned her up without asking anything, and then allowed the little girl to leave. </seg>
<seg id="29"> before she left, the teacher urged her: "if you want to read, just come to me; there are many books here." </seg>
<seg id="30"> The little girl whose spirits were still rattled took a good look at her, and then ran off like she was flying, never appearing again. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Time passed rapidly like running water, and without realizing it, ten years of time had passed in a flash; </seg>
<seg id="32"> the teacher had already forgotten this event long ago, but she still lived in the same place, leading a peaceful and serene life. </seg>
<seg id="33"> One day at noon, a knocking sound came from outside the door. </seg>
<seg id="34"> After she had opened the house door, she saw a young and beautiful unfamiliar girl, who had a face full of smiles and a large pile of gifts in her hands. </seg>
<seg id="35"> "Who are you looking for?," </seg>
<seg id="36"> she asked uncertainly. </seg>
<seg id="37"> The girl then excitingly talked at length. </seg>
<seg id="38"> With great difficulty, she suddenly discovered from the story told by this strange girl that it turned out she was the little girl from before, ten years before; she had already graduated from college without any trouble, and now she had gone to the trouble to come to pay a call to the teacher. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The eyes of this young girl were glinting with tears, and she spoke softly: "Although I still don't understand even to this day why were you willing to pretend you were my mother and rescue me, I always think, during these past ten years, about how I've always wanted to call you mother." </seg>
<seg id="40"> The teacher's eyes also began to become fuzzy; </seg>
<seg id="41"> she asked with some curiosity: "if that day I had not helped you, what would have been the result?" </seg>
<seg id="42"> The girl's face immediately became somber; lightly she shook her head and said; "I can't say for sure; perhaps I would have done something stupid, even died." </seg>
<seg id="43"> The teacher's heart suddenly trembled and she began to inwardly congratulate herself. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The decision that she made in a moment of thought that year could actually influence the life of a person in such a way as this. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Looking at the happy smiles on the face of the girl she also began to smile. </seg>

<seg id="49"> Man's nature at birth is good, </seg>
<seg id="50"> everybody has a heart of compassion; </seg>

<seg id="1"> <HEADLINE> Military Survey: How Long Can Iran Last Against American Air Strikes? </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> <POSTER> Yun Feiquan </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> If you make the analogy of a traditional war of attrition as making your opponent bleed until he dies, then modern warfare is like firing a gun into your opponent's head, making him become a 'vegetable' before he can even begin to bleed. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The difference between Iran and America's military does not lie in numbers, instead it lies in the understanding of modern warfare. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Iran, which fought an eight-year war with Iraq with no clear winner, still seems to not have come to an understanding of the true meaning of modern high-tech warfare. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In the last few days, after analyzing the redeployment of American forces, England's "International Intelligence Commentary" pointed out that American forces are currently carrying out preparations to initiate a large scale air strike against Iran. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The Current Situation of Iran's Air Force Worrisome </seg>
<seg id="8"> The current situation of Iran's air force is relatively similar to Iraq's air force before the 2003 war. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Iran does not have the ability to research and develop modern weapons by itself, and also is restricted by a Western arms embargo; </seg>
<seg id="10"> as soon as a war breaks out, whether or not the old aircraft in Iran's air force will be able to get into the air and engage American forces is still a big question. </seg>
<seg id="11"> At present, Iran's air defense system is mainly made up of the air forces of Iran's regular army, land air defense units, and the air defense forces of the Revolutionary Guards. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Among its forces, Iran's air force has approximately 50,000 soldiers, and has over 300 war aircraft of various types; </seg>
<seg id="13"> its main models include American-made F-4 'Phantoms', F-5 'Tigers', F-14 'Tomcats' and Russian-made Mig 29s and so on. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Land-based air defense units are mainly equipped with a series of American-made 'Hawks', British 'Rapiers' and some Russian-made 'SAM' land-to-air missiles. </seg>
<seg id="15"> As to the present situation of Iran's air defense power, American military expert Harold Hutchinson and Russian Government and Military Analysis Institute military expert Vladimir Mytashin and others have analyzed this.  They believe that, looking at the current situation, there still exist some leaks in Iran's air defense abilities and the air defense system establishment. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Hutchinson believes that, talking about its comprehensive strength, Iran's air forces and America's military are just not on the same level. </seg>
<seg id="17"> A great number of American-made fighters that Iran is equipped with cannot be used because they lack spare parts and need upgraded maintenance. </seg>
<seg id="18"> As of now only about 10 or a few more of the F-14 fighters which were once seen as the trump card in Iran's air force can even get off the ground and fly, </seg>
<seg id="19"> and the actual battle reliability of the AIM-54 model 'Phoenix' cruise missile, which is reputed to have over the horizon strike ability, is suspicious. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Mytashin points out that the air defense missile systems that America supplied to Iran in the 70's and 80's have already lost their battle abilities because they lack spare parts, </seg>
<seg id="21"> and some other air defense weapons not incorporated into their own systems obtained from Russia and other countries have no ability whatsoever to contend with American forces that have strong electromagnetic countermeasures. </seg>
<seg id="22"> A Pieced Together Force Influences Iran's Fighting Power </seg>
<seg id="23"> Iran's government obviously has recognized that its fate in a war depends on whether or not it can defend the skies above its head, and has thus made preparations at the last minute, and tried to further piece together and strengthen its air defense systems. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Looking at this at the present, Iran's method can be boiled down to these two strategies: </seg>
<seg id="25"> First, hide important nuclear facilities with the utmost effort, and strengthen their ability to resist attack. </seg>
<seg id="26"> According to England's "The Times," Iran already has deeply hidden its Natanz nuclear factory and Isfahan uranium enrichment center 18 meters underground, and added a two-meter thick concrete protecting shell. </seg>
<seg id="27"> However, American forces are one step ahead.  As early as during the 1991 Gulf War, America had seen the efficiency of underground bunkers in air defense warfare and carried out an onslaught of research and development on various kinds of earth-penetrating bombs. </seg>
<seg id="28"> After more than 10 years of specific research and development, American forces now already have a whole series of battle methods and weapons to deal with underground reinforced bunkers. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Recently Iran also purchased advanced air defense weapons from Russia. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Since late last year, the Iranian government and Russia have successively reached agreements on the purchase of 'Pechora' 2A model air defense missile systems, as well as 29 'Tor" M1 model air defense missile systems worth 700 million USD. </seg>
<seg id="31"> However, modern warfare is a measuring of system against system. </seg>
<seg id="32"> All of America's various air strike weapons were researched and developed by America, have seen many years of actual battle hardening, and have already been ground into a set of battle machines with objective effectiveness. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Whereas Iran has been piecing together 'new weapons' from other countries.  It is still a question if Iran can create any battle power in such a short time. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Iran's Deficiencies Not Only in Weapons </seg>
<seg id="35"> The 'AirLand Battle' concept was first brought up in "Operations" published by the U.S. armed forces in 1982.  It emphasized taking advantage of air superiority to carry out strikes on the enemy's strategic high value targets, and paralyzing the command system of the enemy as soon as war began, making enemies with even large and strong regular armed forces just "a piece of meat on the cutting board." </seg>
<seg id="36"> In the 1991 Gulf War, the 1999 Kosovo War and the 2003 Iraq War, what American forces have been concerned about is not how many aircraft the opponent has, but instead the range of its 'Tomahawk' cruise missiles. </seg>
<seg id="37"> The Iranian government is already carrying out preparations for air strikes that might happen, and has also begun procedures to strengthen its air defense abilities. However, Iran, which fought an eight-year war with Iraq with no clear winner, still seems not to have come to an understanding of the true meaning of modern high-tech warfare. </seg>
<seg id="38"> With the progress of military restructuring of American forces over the past few years, America's air strike performance is already totally different than the carpet bombing of the Vietnam era, and instead relies on various high-tech weapons, the support of high accuracy current information technology and total-depth air strike ability. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Facing these kind of air strikes, exactly how long Iran's land-based air defense systems can last is still an unknown. </seg>

<seg id="1"> <HEADLINE> Joining With Google to Take on Microsoft, Dell Takes "Shelving Fees" From Software Providers </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> <POSTER> Yun Feiquan </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> Dell (Dell Inc. US) and Google verified on Tuesday that Dell is currently testing the installation of a Google software package on personal computers. </seg>
<seg id="4"> This move will likely become a serious threat to the leading position in the personal computer software market of Microsoft (Microsoft Corp, MSFT). </seg>
<seg id="5"> Jess Blackburn, news spokesman for Dell, expressed that his company is currently evaluating Google's software. </seg>
<seg id="6"> After installing this software, personal computer users can use it to carry out searches on the Internet and also search the information saved on personal computers. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Blackburn verified that at present the software his company is evaluating includes a Dell homepage supported by Google, a Google desktop search system and a Google tool bar. </seg>
<seg id="8"> At the same time, Google news spokesman Jon Murchinson verified his company is currently testing a batch of software developed by Google with Dell. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Before this, "The Wall Street Journal" had a report saying that IT parvenu Google is currently carrying out talks with Dell, HP (Hewlett-Packard) and others, aiming to convince these computer manufacturing giants to install Google software on their computers. </seg>
<seg id="10"> According to "The Wall Street Journal," which cited a person with inside information, to reach this goal Google will likely pay as much as one billion USD to Dell over the next three years. </seg>
<seg id="11"> However, neither of the two companies has revealed any relevant details. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Besides this, HP has declined to comment. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Microsoft news spokesperson Neil Charney refused to comment on the above news. </seg>
<seg id="14"> At present, Microsoft is currently planning to release the search tools of the next generation Windows operating system, as well as strengthening the development of its online services. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The day that this news became public, Google stock once again fell by 4.46%, reaching 367.92 USD. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Microsoft stock fell 1% that day, closing at 26.94 USD. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Some analysts point out that Google is currently impatiently searching for a direction for expansion besides internet searches, and joining with Dell and other PC giants will spur Google on to threaten Microsoft's central services. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Analyst Matt Rosoff of market research company Directions on Microsoft expressed that Google is impatient to expand new income flows.  This is certainly what Microsoft is concerned and worried about. </seg>
<seg id="19"> However, there are also analysts who don't think so. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Analyst Charles Di Bona of market analysis company Sanford C. Bernstein pointed out that it is still too early for Google to shake Microsoft Windows' leading position. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Noted by the Reporter: Google Loosening Up Microsoft's Empire? </seg>
<seg id="22"> Hui Zhengyi </seg>
<seg id="23"> There is no doubt that computers have already become a necessity of life and work. </seg>
<seg id="24"> However, while everybody is familiar with operating computers, there are only a small number of people who actually understand the principles that make computers work. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Just like using 'simpleton' cameras, as long as the user interface is good and you use convenient software, the great majority of dummies can still thoroughly enjoy their computer . </seg>
<seg id="26"> Because of this, the software that PC producers provide when they ship their goods often decides the use habits of a large number of consumers. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Microsoft has firmly taken hold of the personal computer operating system market through this measure. </seg>
<seg id="28"> As of now, Microsoft's new opponent Google also intends to use this method to take a share for itself. </seg>
<seg id="29"> A famous Taiwanese economic media outlet recently gave an interesting analogy to this. </seg>
<seg id="30"> "Dell, HP and other computer producers are starting to manage the computers they are sending out as the product shelves in a supermarket, and taking a "shelving fee" from software companies. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Successful bidders can make their software appear in the 'crucial 10 minutes' when users first turn on their new computers, and lead consumers to use their products. </seg>
<seg id="32"> This type of fee pattern is like supermarkets taking a shelving fee from food suppliers." </seg>
<seg id="33"> There is no doubt that this phenomenon shows that Microsoft's control is currently loosening. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Microsoft managers have warned Bill Gates that if Google starts to pay personal computer manufacturers to allow computers to be deployed with Google's software, then Microsoft's hegemonic position will in the end be threatened. </seg>
<seg id="35"> No matter what the final result is, the leisurely days of Microsoft sitting in the lead position will likely become history. </seg>
<seg id="36"> After all, fighting an empire is easy, but defending an empire is hard. </seg>

<seg id="3"> Sword of Righteousness: Looking Forward to 2006 </seg>
<seg id="4"> Author: sword of righteousness </seg>
<seg id="5"> I remember at the beginning of 2005, Hong Kong's "Apple Daily" published an article; its title was "The Falun wheel turns often to capture the enemy nation." </seg>
<seg id="6"> The article said that 2004 was a year in which Falun Gong advanced triumphantly. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The article enumerated that all the manners in which the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) overseas officials took to repress Falun Gong in various situations all failed, and students of Falun Gong across the world spoke the truth and left the CCP without any face. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But if you compare the great surge of those quitting the party because of the "Nine Criticisms" of 2005, then 2004 really doesn't seem like much. </seg>
<seg id="9"> So, what will 2006 bring? </seg>
<seg id="10"> From two events that happened early this year we can get an inkling as to the development of this year. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The first event is the publishing of "Eradicating Evil."  This article pronounces a sentence that the final day of the CCP's special operatives after July 20, 1999 will soon arrive. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In regards to this article, perhaps many people will waver between believing or doubting it, or will not be able to believe it, </seg>
<seg id="13"> but no matter if you believe it or not, history and fact will provide proof! </seg>
<seg id="14"> Of course, the special operatives of the CCP are just like rats that live in the sewer, </seg>
<seg id="15"> their "natural or unnatural" death will not bring the attention of society or public opinion, </seg>
<seg id="16"> However, the large-scale smiting or repentance of domestic and foreign based CCP operatives will bring about a huge attack and convulsion to the CCP power hierarchy! </seg>
<seg id="17"> Under the awful magnitude of the smiting of their world, they will have to seriously consider their path of retreat and path of life -- quit the party, revolt and run, or change sides. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Because of this, the 'CCP hyper-stable bureaucratic system bloc' held up by filthy interests will begin to shake, dissolve and collapse! </seg>
<seg id="19"> There is also one event, that is, the hunger strike movement against those maintaining power begun by Gao Zhisheng. </seg>
<seg id="20"> This movement that began suddenly and was not well received at first, exceeded expectations and received an enthusiastic response from all over the world, and was responded to jointly by figures and forces everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="21"> If this movement can become a nexus between various righteous powers and the suffering people, as well as become successful and large, then the final hit to the CCP, this wicked regime that is on the precipice ready to fall, will be given. </seg>
<seg id="22"> If we say that 2005 was the year that defeated communism on the spiritual level, then 2006 is the stage of defeating communism on a spiritual and material level. </seg>
<seg id="23"> With the further promulgation of the "Nine Criticisms," the deepening of the tide of people quitting the party, the self-dissolution of the CCP itself and the agglomeration and shaping up of outside righteous power, the life of the CCP monster will formally enter its final hours! </seg>
<seg id="24"> The desires of heaven and earth have already coalesced, the hand of God and the power of the people are currently assembling. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The long sword that relies on heaven is directly pointed at the CCP monster! </seg>
<seg id="26"> If you say 2004 was a year in which we advanced triumphantly, and 2005 is a year in which we surged forward with great momentum, then what will the end words be for 2006? </seg>
<seg id="27"> I hope it will be a huge change that startles heaven, victory and triumphant return! </seg>

<seg id="5"> Title: Xu Zhiyong: a Letter to Linyi City Committee Secretary Li Qun - Gangster Methods Will Hurt You </seg>
<seg id="6"> Posting Website: Like old friends even though we just met (Wed Feb 8 13:56:14 2006), this website (yjrg.net) </seg>
<seg id="7"> As of yesterday, the Linyi government that you lead has already illegally held Chen Guangcheng under house arrest for 165 days. </seg>
<seg id="8"> You have joined with the gangster underworld to illegally imprison a legal citizen who has been blind in both eyes for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="9"> You cut the telephone line in his home, and installed cell phone disrupting equipment in his courtyard. </seg>
<seg id="10"> You have also beaten up his family members on numerous occasions. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Your barbaric actions have already passed beyond the bottom margin of civilized society. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In October 2005 you used gangster methods to beat up me and lawyer Li Fangping, but we endured it, and always did our best to understand your difficulties, even tolerating you putting Chen Guangcheng under house arrest for a time. </seg>
<seg id="13"> However, 165 days have passed, and you have not constrained yourselves, and instead have become even more severe. </seg>
<seg id="14"> You send out large teams of police and gangsters to harass the village citizens. </seg>
<seg id="15"> You continue to arrest and beat up village citizens. </seg>
<seg id="16"> You have already gone too far! </seg>
<seg id="17"> Today, while you continue to organize gangsters to surround and block Cheng Guangcheng, I clearly remind you that gangster methods will in the end hurt yourself. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The beginning of the situation is worth your looking back and thinking about. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Linyi's Family Planning is dead last for the entire province, </seg>
<seg id="20"> and as the secretary of the city committee, you being somewhat worried is understandable. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, thinking that you can only use violence and force to implement national legal policies because Linyi's citizens are unsophisticated is wrong. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Citizens not cooperating with the behavior of the government, in the end whose fault is this? </seg>
<seg id="23"> Is it because citizens are unsophisticated, or is it because the government has for a long time used lies and deceits leading to very low public confidence? </seg>
<seg id="24"> If you say that 10 years ago this kind of governmental behavior still didn't seem that preposterous; then in 2005, when Chinese society has already had obvious improvements and human rights protection has already been added into the constitution, don't you think that your barbaric behavior is far off the mark? </seg>
<seg id="25"> Why don't you think about it a bit?  Why is it only you guys in Linyi that still dare to do stuff like this? </seg>
<seg id="26"> How is it that you guys in Linyi cannot use democratic and legal methods to enforce the law? </seg>
<seg id="27"> When Chen Guangcheng and a group of brave citizens reported the facts of this barbaric enforcing of the law, through the involvement of Teng Biao and a group of lawyers bravely maintaining the rights of citizens and after the State Family Planning Committee completed its investigations, Linyi City could have heartily given an explanation and come to an understanding with the public. </seg>
<seg id="28"> After all, family planning is a problem characteristic of China. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Everybody could have understood and forgiven your difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="30"> However, you took further absurd actions - catching Chen Guangcheng in Beijing and bringing him back.  You also implicated him in the crime of illegally providing national confidential information. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Don't you think that this crime is rather absurd for a blind person who lives in a poor mountain village? </seg>
<seg id="32"> Actually, you only need to correct your mistakes, you only need to do good.  Do you really fear the criticism of a blind person? </seg>
<seg id="33"> Do you really have to assign over 10 people to watch over him 24 hours a day and even try to pin utterly preposterous crimes onto him? </seg>
<seg id="34"> On October 4, 2005, Lawyer Li Fangping and I went to the ancient village of Dongshi where we expressed an extremely clear standpoint hoping to resolve this contradiction. </seg>
<seg id="35"> We suggested that we first talk with your officials, and see what ideas and demands you had. </seg>
<seg id="36"> We took the initiative and suggested we would help you persuade Chen Guangcheng not to say certain things. </seg>
<seg id="37"> We hoped that you wouldn't treat a blind person in such ways, and both parties should have concessions. </seg>
<seg id="38"> However, your decision maker insisted on doing things his own way and he even set up a "meticulous scheme" of his own - to beat us up and illegally detain us. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Do you think you can frighten us into submission in this way? </seg>
<seg id="40"> We have done nothing against the law, </seg>
<seg id="41"> we have no fear, </seg>
<seg id="42"> and although China's rule of law is not perfect, it is not that there is no law and no heaven above. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Do you think you can frighten us into submission by using gangster methods?  Then you have seriously underestimated our resolve and perseverance. </seg>
<seg id="44"> As long as we are willing, we have many people and many legal reasons to go to Linyi, or go and see Chen Guangcheng. </seg>
<seg id="45"> You can beat up lawyer and scholar once, twice, three times; every time will be widely reported and paid attention to. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Do you really dare to beat us 10 times? </seg>
<seg id="47"> Are you not very concerned with your official post? </seg>
<seg id="48"> If there is anybody who is really hurt, is your official position that secure? </seg>
<seg id="49"> If you do not listen to our reasonable advice, and instead employ some low-level gangster methods, don't you think this is very dangerous and very foolish? </seg>
<seg id="50"> I want to clearly tell you that in China there are many outstanding citizens who obey the law and are true to their consciences. </seg>
<seg id="51"> We aren't afraid of the gangster underworld, </seg>
<seg id="52"> and we cannot abide the wanton trampling of the lowest margin of human civilization. </seg>
<seg id="53"> If you go too far, we will confidently and calmly face your clubs with group after group and go forward until you finally shrink back. </seg>
<seg id="54"> It should be clear to you, using gangster methods is nothing good for you. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Don't think that you can hide behind a curtain and be free of your relationship with those ruffian gangsters who beat up villagers. </seg>
<seg id="56"> In the end, I want to remind you, please be nice to Chen Guangcheng. </seg>
<seg id="57"> This person who has been blind since childhood, graduated from the Institute of Chinese Medicine, self-studied law and English, once sued Beijing's Subway Company to get better benefits for the blind, brought running water to the villagers, and became the famous "Lawyer Chen" known near and far. </seg>
<seg id="58"> You went as far as using shameless persons to slander him on the Internet, and also tried to frame him with the crime of illegally providing confidential information to foreigners.  Don't you think that you have gone too far? </seg>
<seg id="59"> Your house arrest of Chen Guangcheng is illegal, and is dangerous to you as well. </seg>
<seg id="60"> Originally you could have released him, </seg>
<seg id="61"> and although your barbaric execution of the law would have stopped, even if he criticized you, how long could he go on? </seg>
<seg id="62"> Instead, today you are continuing to further debase your own image. </seg>
<seg id="63"> As long as Chen Guangcheng does not get freedom, you will not get one day of rest. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Your torture of him is already enough, </seg>
<seg id="65"> and if you still want to pin a crime on him or still want to utilize further gangster methods, we will definitely not stand to the side and just watch. </seg>

</poster>
<seg id="3"> I am extremely disappointed to admit: The Chinese ethnicity does not deserve democracy!!! </seg>
<seg id="4"> Aren't the people posting here doing just this thing! </seg>
<seg id="5"> It's just sad that people on the Internet seeing this are not many (compared to 1.4 billion), </seg>
<seg id="6"> The number of people who are online and are concerned and take part in these types of subjects is even smaller: I am confident in asserting - they are less than 1% of those that use the Internet! </seg>
<seg id="7"> And what about this Internet having the largest, most comprehensive, most advanced, most expensive, and best security programs in the world! </seg>
<seg id="8"> Indeed. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Agony, disappointment, helplessness, even thinking of submission; but to live one's life, besides fighting yourself, who can you place hope on? </seg>
<seg id="10"> Although the planning of affairs rests with man, to complete affairs rests with heaven. Still, even if my plans do not succeed, if I do not work hard towards my ideals I will believe that I myself am wrong and deserve to live the life of a dog. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Working hard towards righteousness, I will add some beauty to my life in this way alone, at least in my heart and in my appraisal of myself. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In fact, I don't need to be worried with China's future at all, </seg>
<seg id="13"> because the world environment already cannot allow a regime that for a such a long time has not used elections. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It's only a matter of time. </seg>
<seg id="15"> It's just that I sigh that the Chinese ethnicity is 'extremely lucky', we have always been put on a hellish path of torture and awfulness during the turns of history by world classed and superman classed monsters.  Even though some call the high piles of bones and pools of blood this path extracts as glorious, and force us to be proud of our gloriousness. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Dark nights are everywhere, China is endless. </seg>
<seg id="17"> With China's first emperor Qinshihuang and Confucius, the people violently died young. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Qinshihuang was openly a tyrant, Confucius brain washed covertly. </seg>
<seg id="19"> It's not that Chinese are not deserving of democracy, it's that the genes of democracy have already been repressed. </seg>
<seg id="20"> For a nation that has been around for three thousand years, if its ethnic culture had democratic genes, then this nation would have much earlier become a democracy. </seg>
<seg id="21"> When Athens established a democratic system, when Rome established a republic, when the English passed the Magna Carta, when the French published the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, when Americans published the Declaration of Independence, what were the Chinese doing? </seg>
<seg id="22"> Before the Mongolians came into the central China plains, the Mongols elected a leader at the Kurultai, the Manchurians had democratic discussions of government between the King and ministers, why is it when they came to the Han region these tendencies were put out? </seg>
<seg id="23"> The Chinese pursue material resources, and have no interest whatsoever in spiritual beliefs and political power. </seg>
<seg id="24"> I don't believe it.  If Chinese had universal suffrage, they'd sell it for a salty pancake. </seg>
<seg id="25"> 500,000 years later, if the Chinese want democracy, then there will certainly need to be an earthquake; those who can run, run! </seg>

<seg id="3"> Special Envoy of the Dalai Lama Carries Out Closed Meetings with Chinese Officials </seg>
<seg id="4"> The Dalai Lama has emphasized that he hopes Tibet will be autonomous but not independent. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The special envoy of the Dalai Lama, exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, is currently in Beijing carrying out closed meetings with Chinese officials, but the details have not been released. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This is the fifth formal meeting with the exiled government of the Dalai Lama since 2002 when China reinstated ties. </seg>
<seg id="7"> However, it's the same as before, both sides are carrying out closed meetings and the details have not been revealed. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Reporters say that both sides have carried out multiple talks, but as of now they still do not have any results of real substance. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The Dali Lama, exiled in north India, said that he hopes for Tibet to be autonomous, not independent. </seg>
<seg id="10"> China refused to comment on the two party talks. </seg>
<seg id="11"> However, analysts say that Beijing looks forward to the two party talks, some reasons being that it's worried if the 70 year old spiritual leader dies, it will likely lead to an increase of unsatisfactory sentiments of Tibetans toward Chinese rule. </seg>

<seg id="13"> The delegation of the Dali Lama's exiled government are lead by Kelsang Gyaltsen.  He has also been the leading representative for the past several meetings. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The spokesperson for the Tibet exiled government said that the several talks carried out with Chinese officials in Switzerland in 2005 were extremely "confidential and frank."  This brings hope to Tibetans. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The spokesperson said that their final hope is to reach a groundwork with the Chinese leadership according to the talks, resolve relevant problems, allow Tibetans to have freedom, and maintain their cultural identity which they believe is important. </seg>

<seg id="17"> Special Envoy of Dali Lama has Repeated he Does Not Seek Independence </seg>
<seg id="18"> The Dali Lama will go to Washington this month. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Before the Dali Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader, arrives in America on November 8, his special envoy expressed that the exiled Tibetan government does not demand Tibetan independence. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Kelsang Gyaltsen said in Washington that they hope the Chinese government can indeed protect the unique culture and traditions of Tibet. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It's predicted that when the Dali Lama visits America next week he will discuss the problem of Tibet with President Bush, and hope Bush will urge the Chinese government to give Tibet true autonomous power. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The Dali Lama's representatives and Beijing officials carried out direct contact this July in Berne. </seg>
<seg id="23"> "True Autonomy" </seg>
<seg id="24"> Kelsang Gyaltsen pointed out that in the last several years the Tibet exiled government and Chinese authorities have see some positive aspects during talks. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The special envoy of the Dali Lama discovered that Beijing leaders, especially representatives of the United Front Work Department of CPC Central Committee were willing to listen to their viewpoints. </seg>
<seg id="26"> However, Kelsang Gyaltsen said that the Tibet exiled government and the Chinese government still had too many divergences, and the standpoint of both sides had too great a difference. </seg>
<seg id="27"> He said that in the last five years, the exiled Tibetan government had already done all it could to respond to China's demand of creating a good environment for talks, </seg>
<seg id="28"> and China should also create a good environment for the Tibet problem, and not just attack the Dali Lama. </seg>
<seg id="29"> He said that the Dali Lama does not demand Tibetan independence, and Tibet is a part of China, but the Chinese government must protect the unique culture of Tibet and "allow Tibetans to truly have autonomy." </seg>
<seg id="30"> Besides this, Kelsang Gyaltsen pointed out that some Chinese think that once the Dali Lama dies, the Tibet problem will disappear. </seg>
<seg id="31"> He said this way of thinking is extremely dangerous, because once the Dali Lama is not around, China will have lost a historic opportunity to resolve the Tibet problem. </seg>
<seg id="32"> He said that, as long as the Chinese government is responsive to the demands brought up by the Dali Lama, and puts forth a final method of resolution, the Dali Lama will then not need to discuss the Tibet problem in the international community. </seg>

<seg id="1"> <HEADLINE> Negotiations and Compromise are Important Methods of Democracy! (ZT) </seg>
</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> <POSTER>  Hou Ze </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> I just saw the post of an Internet friend on "Vast Righteousness - Give Old Mr. Gui Ren." </seg>
<seg id="4"> His (her) original words were: "Negotiations and compromise are important methods of democracy, otherwise democracy will fail because opinions are different and splits form!!!  This point should be amply paid attention to by those hoping for ideal democracy!" </seg>
<seg id="5"> These light and unflavorful words that did not stir any interest in my online friends got me thinking and lamenting. </seg>
<seg id="6"> At this time I wanted to go to ancient China, and I also wanted to go to the past of the west. </seg>
<seg id="7"> I, who seldom post main threads, could not help but post a main thread to reply to this post of my online friend. </seg>
<seg id="8"> First let us look at ancient China. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Everybody knows that China has been a centralized power since the first emperor, Qinshihuang, established a unified China.  After that all dynasties operated under this governmental framework. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Although in the Han period they implemented a "two track system" for a short time, it was just a governmental system of simultaneous operation of feudalist and central power mechanisms, and in the end central power won out. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The results of this type of central power system had its progressive side under the historic conditions of the time, and promoted the development of production capability. </seg>
<seg id="12"> However, we should see that the results of over two thousand years of operating under this system has lead to locations lacking the ingenuity, initiative, and pro-activeness they should have; and in no way could that system set various governing policies suitable for local development with actions that suit local situations. </seg>
<seg id="13"> A pyramid-like governing system also led to lower level officials only looking upward, in all respects taking orders from the next higher level. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Because the local officials of county seats were all appointed by the central government,  there was no space for concessions and negotiations, and don't even bother to bring up the common people. </seg>
<seg id="15"> When the rights of ancient Chinese farmers were encroached on, they could only endure it. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Only when their most basic rights were threatened - that is large scale starvation and the right of life being exploited by cruel government or natural disasters - would they raise up flags and resist. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Over two thousand years numerous peasant rebellions have swept across the nation; from ones that had no forethought such as that led by Chen Sheng and Wu Guang to the planned Yellow Turban Uprising, and again the Huangchao violence of the Tang Dynasty, and the Li Zicheng uprising that ruled as a dynasty for one month.  Except for Zhu Yuanzhang, all of these did not gain victory in the true meaning. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Even the Ming Dynasty established by Zhu Yuanzhang was no more than the replacing of one dynasty with another, and there weren't changes in the system of government. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Zhu Yuanzhang, who was born a commoner and did not have much culture, took China's ancient centralized power system to an abnormal and extreme state, therein losing the vigorous and vital aspects of freedom and tolerance of the Tang Dynasty that system enjoyed, making the system inert. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Any room for discussions of freedom disappeared on the Chinese mainland, </seg>
<seg id="21"> the nature of humanity received the greatest suppression, </seg>
<seg id="22"> and everyone became overcautious, in awe and reverence of the government, and did not dare to say too much. </seg>
<seg id="23"> This was the aftermath of the only peasant rebellion that was successful in two thousand years, leaving the Chinese people with a meager existence for a time. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Now let's look at the Middle Ages that are called the Dark Ages in Western Europe. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Western Europe's Middle Ages was a thousand year era that took shape after western Rome was destroyed by nomadic peoples.  These Middle Ages had no connection to ancient Greece and Rome. </seg>
<seg id="26"> This era's main characteristic was feudalism, that is dividing up lands; </seg>
<seg id="27"> land was divided up further and further among lords and the lower levels had more self-governing rights. </seg>
<seg id="28"> No matter if one was a small feudal lord of a few square kilometers of land, or a male aristocrat with a royal title; because those higher and lower could mutually balance, restrict, and rely on each other, they had the conditions and ability to strive for the rights they should have from their king.  This produced the situation of kings and aristocrats sitting together and carrying out negotiations for each one's benefits that was never seen in ancient China. </seg>
<seg id="29"> They made mutual concessions, and did not use violent methods to beat down and replace opponents. </seg>
<seg id="30"> In this way, by setting various contracts, power continuously was released into the hands of aristocrats and commoners, the rights of aristocrats and commoners became greater and greater, and the power of the king lesser and lesser. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Until finally the English Queen was just a empty position, and did not have any real power. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Democracy was gradually realized in this way! </seg>
<seg id="33"> Now look back and compare, in ancient China, where all power was concentrated in the hands of the emperor (except for Li Shimin of the Tang Dynasty) with almost no aristocrats, peasants could not easily enjoy a kettle of tea or cup of wine with them at the negotiating table, and mutually compromise in a relaxed and happy way to set up contracts with both sides happy. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Under this situation, when the right to life was being exploited, they could only take up violent methods to topple the current dynasty, aiming to replace them. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The result was successive dynasties, from the high point of the Tang Dynasty to the abnormal situation of the Ming Dynasty. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Comparing Chinese and western history, we learn there seems to be not one western country who in ancient times had such intensified contradictions between those in power and those ruled over as in China. </seg>
<seg id="37"> There is not one western country that was like ancient China and had endless peasant uprisings. </seg>
<seg id="38"> In western countries, when the ancient royal households and peasants had contradictions, the aristocrats and commoners appealing for their own benefits thought first to reach resolutions through the method of negotiations, and made some mutual concessions to gradually gain more rights.  Only rarely did they take up the method of violence. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Understanding from this, now that we have entered the 21st century, on the Internet one can still see some fighters of democracy that have received the heritage of utterly absolutist totalitarianism thinking from the Ming Dynasty. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Also because the poison of the cultural revolution has infested their bodies, these fighters of democracy only talk about overthrowing and toppling and nothing else. </seg>
<seg id="41"> These ideas are the biggest obstacles to democracy, because these people do not understand that negotiations and concessions are the most important method on the road to realizing democracy. </seg>

</hl>
<poster>

<seg id="3"> This Spring Festival, the author was lucky to go to a mainland village for the Chinese New Year and visit some relatives and friends. </seg>
<seg id="4"> While infected with the thick atmosphere of the New Year of China's villages, I was uneasy about the lake of cultural activities in the villages. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The author discovered in the village of a close friend and relative that in past years whenever this village celebrated Spring Festival, they would organize the villagers and put on a local play called "horse racing lantern," </seg>
<seg id="6"> This play uses characters from the Three Kingdoms period as its theme.  Adults and children can all play a part in the game and the villagers never get tired of it. </seg>
<seg id="7"> This countryside has many troupes that performed "horse racing lantern," they would not only play in that village but also stroll to other villages; with these troupes coming and going, everything was quite lively. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But this year this village did not organize the play. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It turns out that just purchasing a costume for "horse racing lantern" costs a large amount of money.  In the past villagers would put together their money to buy costumes, and now these costumes are worn out to where they cannot be worn again. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The troupes went door to door asking villagers for a little money, but none of the folks were willing to give anything, and other villages of that countryside also had similar situations. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Without "horse racing lantern," the village became cold and quiet all of a sudden; </seg>
<seg id="12"> adults began to play mahjong, </seg>
<seg id="13"> children began to play cards, </seg>
<seg id="14"> and all the villagers said this New Year was boring. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Setting off firecrackers and playing mahjong became the main scenes in the villages celebrating Chinese New Year. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The tendency of gambling is incessant despite repeated prohibitions, and tends to spread rampantly.  Seeing losses and wins reaching over 10,000 RMB has become a common thing, especially for the large number of farmers returning from jobs in away from the countryside,  they have become the main characters seen at gambling halls. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The hard earned money from a year of work skips away so easily, </seg>
<seg id="18"> and family disputes brought about by gambling break out frequently; some even become tragedies with families falling apart or people dying. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Some farmers say that they not only gamble during the Chinese New Year, but also participate in gambling when they are not farming; </seg>
<seg id="20"> if you don't gamble you have no place to go. </seg>
<seg id="21"> If you want to do some cultured activities in the village, finding "entertainment" is too hard; </seg>
<seg id="22"> not only does the village not have facilities and funds, there is no one to organize them. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In this aspect, there is no doubt that the practice of Jiangxi Province is a happy note for farmers. </seg>
<seg id="24"> To enrich the cultural life of the farmer masses, Jiangxi's provincial government began to implement the "government puts out money, the market operates it, villages and towns build stages, and farmers watch plays" policy since last September. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Every year the government arranges at least 60 million RMB of special funds for the villages' cultural causes, sending excellent cultural products to the masses of the villages. </seg>
<seg id="26"> With the beginning of the Chinese New Year, the government put out another 40 million RMB, for a total of 100 million RMB of special funds to establish villages' cultural causes. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The things that have been bought with this special funding are fairly substantial: </seg>
<seg id="28"> The fund invites various professional cultural and arts performance groups to carry out performances in villages no less than four times every year in every countryside and town. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It invites all levels of movie companies to organize groups to come to villages and show movies - at least six story films or documentaries every year in every administrative village. </seg>
<seg id="30"> It organizes and opens up cultural activities for the masses that have local characteristics - at least two to three times each year for every countryside and town. </seg>
<seg id="31"> From this "shopping list", it's not hard for us to see that the government is not just putting out a bit of money and that's it, but is making painstaking efforts to figure out how to use limited funding to give cultural feasts that exceed the expected values for the vast number of farmers . </seg>
<seg id="32"> At present, there is not one of the vast number of farmers who is not ecstatically happy about being exempt from the "state grain tax." </seg>
<seg id="33"> If all governments could be like Jiangxi's and "foot the bill" for cultural activities enriching the farmer masses, then this would be another joy for farmers. </seg>
<seg id="34"> This "joy" would not only allow farmers to escape the mahjong table and become involved in cultural activities, it would also add "bricks and tiles" to the construction of socialist new villages. </seg>

</hl>
<poster>
<seg id="2"> <POSTER> peirongwangsohu@gmail.com </seg>
</poster>
<seg id="3"> Wang Peirong's child being kidnapped was a false alarm </seg>
<seg id="4"> At a little past 9:00 p.m. on January 24, 2006, Wang Peirong's child completely related the following: </seg>
<seg id="5"> On the morning of January 24, 2006 when Wang Peirong's child was making up for a missed physics class in Xuzhou's Number Three High School, the gate guard called her out of class. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The gate guard said to the child that three males of unclear identification had said to the gate guard that because her mother and father were on bad terms, the child, Wang Tianjiao, had not returned home for three days. </seg>
<seg id="7"> "At present her mother was missing, and we are the managers of her mother's working unit, and would like to go into the Number Three High School and take the child with us." </seg>
<seg id="8"> She said to the gate guard that what these three men said was totally untrue, and would not agree to go with them. </seg>
<seg id="9"> With the help of the gate guard, the child was not taken away. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Wang Peirong's child gave her mother's manager a telephone call to ask him to confirm this.  That manager said he did not send people to Xuzhou's Number Three High School. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The child then called her father's manager. </seg>
<seg id="12"> When the child called her father's manager, </seg>
<seg id="13"> she said that there were three people that came to the Number Three High School to take her away. </seg>
<seg id="14"> That manager asked: "Why didn't you go with them?" </seg>
<seg id="15"> She answered: "If I went with them I'd be dead." </seg>
<seg id="16"> After saying this the child hung up the phone. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Listening to Wang Peirong's child relating this, one feels that the situation was serious and so Wang Peirong reported this to the police. </seg>
<seg id="18"> On January 25, the feedback information from the police station was that what was related by Wang Peirong's child was basically true. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The police station asked the Chinese University of Mining's office of security if they sent people to the Number Three High School looking for Wang Peirong's child.  They answered they did not. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The police stations asked subordinate units of the Chinese University of Mining's office of security if they sent people to look for the child.  The answer once again was no. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Relevant departments told Wang Peirong and her family to be careful of safety. </seg>
<seg id="22"> After this incident, leaders of relevant departments of Xuzhou were extremely concerned, </seg>
<seg id="23"> and through the detective department of Xuzhou's Ministry of Public Safety, they eliminated the likelihood of kidnapping the child. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Wang Peirong thanked leaders of relevant departments of Xuzhou city and the detective department of Xuzhou's Ministry of Public Safety. </seg>
<seg id="25"> This was a false alarm, and the main reason for this false alarm was likely the gate guard of the Number Three High School. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The detective department of Xuzhou's Ministry of Public Safety now has investigated it clearly: On January 24, three managers of Wang Peirong from the College of Science were urgently looking for Wang Peirong because they could not find her (as of now nobody knows what had happened to Wang Peirong), they thought to look for the teachers of Wang Peirong's child at the Number Three High School, and ask them if the child was in Xuzhou or not. </seg>
<seg id="27"> A serious subject: Why is the danger of being corrupt relatively low, and the cost of being anti-corrupt instead relatively high? </seg>
<seg id="28"> http://bbs.people.com.cn/bbs/ReadFile?whichfile=44796&typeid=39 </seg>
<seg id="29"> With the current cadre mechanisms and anti-greed mechanisms, what greedy officials need to worry about is managing those several related officials, and not the multitudes of the people. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Thus, as soon as he thinks he has successfully hoodwinked or flattened out those several officials that effect his fate, then he can be at ease with his boldness and enjoy a great career of corrupt accumulation of wealth as his heart desires, and ignore the hardships of the masses surrounding him. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Alternatively, if a ordinary person with no power sees injustice and comes out against corruption, he will likely bring about cruel attacks and retributions to himself, </seg>
<seg id="32"> or have a political collar placed around his neck, and be put in a position to die at any time before he is victorious. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Comparing the two: the risk in being corrupt is relatively low, the cost of being anti-corrupt is relatively high. </seg>

<seg id="2"> Western India was battered by strong winds and torrential rains over the weekend.  Some areas saw serious flooding, and all domestic and overseas flights to and from Mumbai, the major city in the west, were stopped.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Relief officials said today that in total it had caused the deaths of 43 people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> From June to September every year, strong winds and heavy rains brought by the monsoon often cause widespread flood disasters and even human casualties in India, a country with a population of 1.1 billion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In this disaster caused by torrential rains, half of the victims were carried away and drowned in the floods; the others died because their houses collapsed or from electrocution caused by short circuits.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Mumbai, India's financial center, was also affected.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Over just two days on the 29th and 30th, rainfall in Mumbai reached 243 mm.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Mumbai's chief administrator, Pathak, said that in this city alone, 13 people had died.</seg>
<seg id="9"> City officials appealed for the 15 million residents to avoid going out before the torrential rains eased so as to protect their own safety.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> According to reports from officials and the media, the number of people who have died this year in India because of heavy monsoon rains has risen to 474.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The Press Trust of India quoted the government minister for relief and rehabilitation Kadam as revealing today that in the last week, the monsoon has started in all of India's states one after another, and that the financial losses and casualties have been serious in all areas.  Just in Maharashtra, the state which includes Mumbai, India's largest city, the number of people known to have died has now reached 358.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Reports say that Kadam made the above statement to media and journalists as he was making an inspection of Mumbai.</seg>
<seg id="5"> He said that Maharashtra, which is also India's biggest cotton-producing state, was entirely covered with a vast expanse of water, and there were cities and towns numbering 27 and about 2,000 villages which had been hit by serious flooding.  More than 10,000 affected people had been evacuated to safe shelters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The whole of India, from south to north, started to progressively enter the monsoon season a week ago.  The residents of each state all greeted the heavy rains as relief at the end of a long drought, but didn't expect that the rain would come with unexpected violence, a real deluge.  Highways have become rivers; houses in low-lying areas have been surbmerged in the water; the transport system is nearly paralyzed.  To date, figures show that nearly 500 people have unfortunately lost their lives to the floods.</seg>

At the end of the match, Djokovic was unable to continue to play because he was injured, forfeited and withdrew from the match.  Nadal won and entered the final.  He will replay the titanic struggle for the championship at the French Open against the Swiss king of the tennis world, Federer.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="3"> Djokovic called for medics to treat his back injury during the course of both his last-16 and quarter-final matches.  Today, when he had played to the third set, he again called for a medic to treat him because of a blister on his toe.  He later felt that he could not play on with the injury and decided to forfeit the game.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Fourth seed Djokovic's withdrawal from the game allowed second seed Nadal, who was leading 3-6, 6-1, 4-1, to claim the victory and progress through.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3"> The images were taken by US company DigitalGlobe (DigitalGlobe) on June 11 and have been posted on the ISIS website.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Analysts Albright and Brannan say in a report that the entrance and exit of the tunnel in the images are not clear, but that "one of the roads seems to lead into a tunnel facility.  The other road may also lead to a tunnel entrance/exit."</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The main delegates at the World Trade Organization talks today suggested that the US make major cuts in its agricultural subsidies and that developing countries significantly reduce import duties on industrial products in order to break the deadlock in the Doha round of trade talks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Officials say the new "draft models" require the US to reduce its annual subsidies for agriculture from the 19 billion US dollars permitted at present to 16.2 billion US dollars, and developing countries to adjust and reduce import duties on industrial products to below 23%.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> These suggestions are aimed at breaking the deadlock in which the Doha round of talks has been stuck for nearly six years, and at bringing the 150 members of the WTO to a compromise agreement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Director-general Lamy of the WTO called these suggestions "a fair and reasonable foundation for reaching an agreement which has major long-term targets and balance and is development-oriented."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Lamy said: "The member states will not be completely satisfied with the details of the suggestions, but at present the problems causing differences are fewer than  the problems of reaching agreement."</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> US Treasury Secretary Paulson arrived yesterday on a visit to China.  The US is currently doing all it can to persuade China to carry out further necessary economic reforms and work on environmental protection.  The renminbi exchange rate is an issue that will receive particular attention.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> US diplomats say that Paulson first visited Xining, capital city of China's large northwestern province of Qinghai.</seg>
<seg id="4"> China is currently carrying out a series of plans for environmental protection near the largest freshwater lake in Qinghai Province.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Today Paulson will move on to Beijing to discuss pushing for progress in the US-China Strategic Economic Dialogue started last year and other issues with Chinese chief officials.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The US-China Strategic Economic Dialogue mainly discusses economic, environmental protection and other issues.  Yet, the most important is the issue of the renminbi exchange rate.  US congressmen believe that the renminbi is excessively undervalued.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The trade deficit between the US and China is quickly escalating.  Internal pressure within the US is gradually rising, and congressmen are ready to take retributive action to resist what they call China's unfair trade policies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Last week the US Senate Finance Committee overwhelmingly approved a bill requiring the Treasury to identify a list of countries with "fundamentally misaligned" currency exchange rates.  This opens the door for potential economic sanctions to be brought against Beijing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> US congressmen say that the renminbi is undervalued, which makes the price of goods that China sells to the US extremely cheap, and adds to the trade imbalance between the US and China.  Last year the US's trade deficit with China reached 232.5 billion US dollars.</seg>

<seg id="1"> F1 "Spy Case" Hearing Finished Yesterday; McLaren Escapes Penalties for Now</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Last night Beijing time, the special hearing held by the FIA World Motor Sports Council in Paris over the Ferrari engineer spy case came to a close.  McLaren, who had been summoned, managed a lucky escape: the council decided not to impose any penalty on McLaren for the time being.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The FIA official website published a statement after the hearing, saying: "Vodafone McLaren Mercedes was in possession of confidential Ferrari information, but at present there is insufficient evidence to show that this information was used improperly in the FIA Formula One World Championship.  Therefore no penalty will be imposed."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> However, this does not definitively close the Ferrari engineer spy case.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The Motor Sports Council also said in this decision: "If it is found in the future that the information relating to Ferrari has been used to the detriment of the championship, we reserve the right to request McLaren to return to WMSC for a hearing.  At that time, they may face the penalty of the cancellation of their qualification to take part in the 2007 championship and even the 2008 championship."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Mike Coughlan, the former chief designer for McLaren who has now been suspended from his job, has been found to have been in possession of nearly 800 pages of Ferrari's technical documents.  The contents included sets of details of the design, power, construction, checks, tests, development and operation of Ferrari's 2007 race car.</seg>
<seg id="7"> McLaren insists that no-one else in the team knew about this information before Coughlan was suspended from his job, and that the McLaren car for this season has no elements from Ferrari.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Experts Think Insurance QDIIs Will Not Divert Funds away from Domestic Stock Market in the Short Term</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Chinanews.com, July 30</seg>
<seg id="3"> According to a report in China Securities Journal, the Provisional Measure for the Overseas Investment with Insurance Funds was recently published, and insurance funding has greater room for operation in the capital markets.</seg>
<seg id="4"> China Life Insurance Company's chief investment officer Liu Lefei thinks that with the renminbi appreciation and the domestic capital markets improving, insurance institutions will not make large investments overseas through foreign currency purchases in the short term.  This also means that insurance QDIIs will not divert funds away from the domestic stock market in the short term.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The report says that quite a few insurance institutions hold the same view.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Experts say that because there is currently no renminbi derivatives market as yet, and the risk-avoidance techniques of insurance institutions are not sufficient, the time is not yet ripe for large-scale foreign currency purchases.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Liu Lefei says that in the long term, in terms of asset allocation, overseas investment should occupy a certain proportion of an insurance company's overall allocation.</seg>
<seg id="8"> However, given the fairly large upwards pressure on the renminbi at present, China Life would mainly be using its own funds in foreign currencies for making overseas investment.</seg>
<seg id="9"> In the current situation it should take a cautious attitude toward purchasing foreign currencies to invest overseas.</seg>

<seg id="3"> Over the whole country, 140 million mu of arable land had been affected by drought; 5.88 million people and 4.7 million heads of large livestock suffered temporary shortages of drinking water because of drought.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> On July 29, the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters was urgently organizing to deal with the current serious flood control and drought relief situation.</seg>
<seg id="5"> It called on all provinces along the Huai River and the Huai River Flood Control Headquarters to strengthen their dispatch service, to enhance their maintenance of dikes during periods of receding water, and to strive for a complete victory in the Huai River flood prevention and control.</seg>
</p>
<p>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Chinanews.com, July 31  On the 30th Chen Shui-bian questioned that members of the judiciary on the island may have tried to get involved in elections for leaders in the Taiwan region.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Kao Chin-chih, director-general of Taiwan's "Department of Judicial Administration," said on the same day that the current behavior of judges on the island was not as Chen Shui-bian said, and demanded that Chen Shui-bian give an explanation of his comments.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to reports in Taiwan's United Daily, Chen Shui-bian questioned on the 30th that for political reasons or electoral considerations, judges, prosecutors or investigators may be interfering with, affecting or even trying to control the campaign activities of candidates from all parties.  He said he hoped that this kind of phenomenon did not exist in Taiwan, but that it was perhaps extremely difficult.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Weng Yueh-sheng, "president of the Judicial Yuan" in Taiwan, kept quiet and made no response to Chen Shui-bian's questions, but "Secretary-General" Fan Kuang-chun sent Kao Chin-chih to make a statement on behalf of the "Judicial Yuan."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Kao Chin-chih said that Taiwan's basic law and the "regulations for judges" both explicitly state that judges should be above party factions, must not take part in political party activities, and must not campaign, either.  Judges were all extremely prudent and respected these relevant restrictions, and the "Judicial Yuan" believed that judges all acquit themselves admirably.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Kao Chin-chih gave an example, saying that "High Court Kaohsiung Branch Court" judge Chang Sheng-hsi took part in a class at the Ketagalan Institute a few years ago, the self-regulation council organized by judges decided to punish him because the relevant syllabus had political party implications.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Once Chang Sheng-hsi wanted to take part in the DPP primaries, but because of controversy over retaining his position and taking part in the election, he decided in the end to give up on it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Kao Chin-chih believes that if it's specific judgments in cases, there is relief available at the court level, and one should not infer that judges have political intentions simply based on wins or losses in the verdicts.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Germany Plans to Lower Threshold for Bringing in Professionals</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Staff Writer, Berlin, July 1 (Correspondent Wang Huaicheng)</seg>
<seg id="3"> German Federal Minister of Education and Research Schavan said recently that Germany should lower the qualifying conditions for bringing in foreign professionals in the Immigration Law and solve the problem of the shortage of professionals that Germany is facing through increasing the recruitment of foreign talents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to a report by OECD, by 2010 the number of workers between age 15 and 64 in Germany will be gradually decreasing each year.</seg>
<seg id="5"> If there are not enough immigrants, the labor force in Germany in 2020 will decrease by 6% as compared with the present.</seg>
<seg id="6"> However, reports by organizations such as the German Employers Association and the German Association of Engineers show that there is a relatively large shortage of engineers and professionals in the current job market in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="7"> According to the statistics from Germany's Federal Labor Department, this May, the supply of engineers in the labor market in Germany had a shortfall of about 12,700 people and the supply of technicians had a shortfall of about 9,600 people.</seg>
<seg id="8"> In order to protect native employment, Germany has set a relatively high threshold for bringing in foreign talents.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Germany's Immigration Law stipulates that professionals from non-EU countries should have annual salaries of no less than 85,500 euros in Germany, otherwise they cannot get the permit to work and live in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Schavan suggests that this qualifying amount be reduced to 40,000 to 60,000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Don't Blindly Worship Legal "Theory Circle"</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> It is stipulated in Article 8 of the draft amendment of the Lawyers Law which has been recently submitted to the NPC standing committee for review that people who were once engaged in the profession of researching and teaching laws and have obtained advanced professional titles or equivalent professional levels may be granted the permission to practice law when their applications for lawyers' licenses pass the review by the judicial administrative department of the State Council.</seg>
<seg id="3"> (June 28, the China Youth Daily)</seg>
<seg id="4"> In the legal community there is a distinction between the "theory circle" and the "practice circle."  The former mainly includes the "abstract activities" such as teaching and researching laws, while the latter is more engaged in the "concrete activities" such as litigation, legal counseling, and legal services.</seg>
<seg id="5"> For a long time there has existed a phenomenon of "scholars' mutual contempt" between the legal "theory circle" and the "practice circle."  The "theory circle" believes that the "practice circle" lacks the necessary legal training and consists only of mechanical "legalists," while the "practice circle" criticizes the "theory circle" by pointing out that "theory cannot direct practice."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> With regard to such a labor division, what the law can do is to maintain neutrality rather than vigorously support either party.</seg>
<seg id="7"> However, the "system of specially licensed lawyers" in the Lawyers Law acknowledges in reality the judgment that the legal "theory circle" is superior to the legal "practice circle."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In fact, some experts and scholars who have been engaged in the research and teaching of pure legal theories such as the history of the legal system and the international laws have nothing to do with practicing law no matter how profound their theoretical achievements have been.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Thus, the "system of specially licensed lawyers" has doubtlessly opened up a "bad loophole" for confusing qualification in the legal "practice circle" which will have an extremely negative impact.</seg>
<seg id="10"> There is also more blind worship of the "theory circle" than these.  For example, the phenomenon that expert opinions and expert panels frequently influence and even negate court rulings is also a direct manifestation of such blind worship.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Keep Public Places from Harassment of Peddlers</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> When people go out traveling, they are looking for relaxation, freshness, and freedom, enjoying as much as possible the natural scenery and achievements of civilized society.</seg>
<seg id="3"> However, while traveling in the country, many people have experienced such nuisance as being besieged and cornered by peddlers and middlemen in public places.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Whether you are getting on or off a bus or train, you invariably suffer the harassment of peddlers and some unlicensed middlemen.</seg>
<seg id="5"> They either sell chicken eggs, peanuts, or sesame seed cakes, or newspapers and magazines.  In addition, many unlicensed middlemen make referrals to restaurants and lodgings, even hawking fake certificates, fake receipts, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="6"> If you don't take them, he can chase you for several hundreds of meters as if he would rather die than fail.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In some scenic spots, many tourists also have the same experience.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Before you enter the main gate, someone would come to hawk things like tourist souvenirs and small pieces of arts and crafts.</seg>
<seg id="9"> There are more scenarios of this kind after you go through the gate, which completely ruins even your best mood.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Some media once reported that many foreign tourists coming to Xi'an praised endlessly the places of historic interest and scenic beauty in Xi'an, but felt it was incomprehensible that crowds of peddlers are allowed to hawk their wares everywhere.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Such public places including bus stations and scenic spots are places meant for traveling and recreation.  Attention should be paid to civility and orderliness as well as tranquility and harmony, providing tourists a comfortable and relaxing environment.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The unrestricted entry and exit of peddlers not only disturb the mood of tourists, but also actually destroy the public order of these public places, giving rise to the visual contamination and environmental contamination, while providing the conditions and opportunities for lawless people to make trouble.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The important thing is that these public places are the windows of spiritual civilization construction in the local areas.  A small glimpse can reveal a larger picture.  Not only the image is being damaged but the growth of local economy will also be impacted.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Just imagine, if you want to expand and strengthen the tourism industry but welcome guests traveling from all directions with such a messy tourist environment, who will still want to come, and who still dare to come?</seg>
<seg id="15"> Then how can your tourist economy gain returns?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> As the tourist high season approaches, creating a civilized tourist environment for tourists coming from all directions should be considered the top priority.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Public places are not markets.  The operation by peddlers should be regulated.  Unlicensed operation must be resolutely banned, and there should be relentless crackdown on illegal activities.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Only a civilized and orderly environment can get tourists to come happily, who will leave after fully enjoying themselves and keep the passion for a return trip.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> In a word, keep public places from the harassment of peddlers.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Jianguomen Neighborhood in Dongcheng District of Beijing gave away things like refrigerators as rewards to twelve households that voluntarily withdrew from the welfare system.</seg>
<seg id="3"> (The Beijing News, July 10)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> While feeling happy for these families for the improvement of their lives, this writer is ambivalent toward the proposal of "voluntary withdrawal from the welfare system" and the "reward-giving" method.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The deputy director of the Jianguomen Neighborhood office said, "In response to the issue of the welfare fraud, encouraging voluntary withdrawal from the welfare system aims to set a good example for other households on welfare."</seg>
<seg id="6"> If it is to encourage other welfare recipients to get out of their difficult situations through their own efforts, then this example is indeed worth promoting.  If this is intended to "appeal" to those longtime cheaters of the welfare system, then it may be a bit naive.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Working to distinguish between real and fake welfare recipients and sort them out, we should rely more on the law.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The relevant department should stress the obligations that welfare recipients must carry out while enjoying the welfare: for example, promptly notifying the changes in the family members and incomes, reporting the status of employment, accepting regular reviews, etc.  On the other hand, the relevant department should step up monitoring and inspection.</seg>
<seg id="9"> After all, only "withdrawing from the welfare system according to the law" is the long-term strategy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Who will foot the bill for the material rewards given by the neighborhood to the households that withdrew from the welfare system?</seg>
<seg id="11"> As a level-one government organization, the neighborhood's expenses are covered by the funding from the government budget.</seg>
<seg id="12"> However, is it legitimate to spend this sum of tax payers' money?</seg>
<seg id="13"> On the one hand, households that have withdrawn from the welfare system prove that they have attained certain abilities to be "self-sufficient;" on the other hand, aren't there still people who apply for the welfare?</seg>
<seg id="14"> The funding from the government budget which is called "life-saving" money should be used to provide timely help instead of extra bonus.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> On July 10, Liu Gangyi, the party committee secretary of Mulan Township, Xindu District, Chengdu City, who is the first township party committee secretary through public nomination and direct election in the whole country, received his fourth democratic evaluation since he took office.  The rate of satisfaction reached 97%.</seg>
<seg id="3"> During his conversation with reporters, Liu Gangyi defined himself as a "service provider."</seg>
<seg id="4"> (Yesterday, The Beijing News)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The "service provider" as spoken by Liu Gangyi is probably more truthful and more believable than the "service provider" as spoken by some appointed cadres.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The greatest advantage of public nomination and direct election as compared with the system of appointment lies in the fact that in the former the source of power is mainly determined by ordinary party members and the masses, while in the latter it is mainly appointed by upper-level organizations.  And where the power originates determines that the former must take its  responsibility to the general public as top priority.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The source of power and to whom they should answer are the basic factors that determine how the elected will go about their work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Some people suspect that this kind of "democratic evaluation" is more like a "democracy show."</seg>
<seg id="9"> My opinion is that it is better to have this form of "democratic evaluation" than nothing at all.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Considering the history and current status of China's grassroots democratic and political construction, I think that it is already a major breakthrough to have public nomination and direction election.  Being a major component of this innovation, the democratic evaluation is not to be underestimated in promoting the grassroots democratic and political construction.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Patil is the presidential candidate for the ruling party INC, while Shekhawat is from the opposition party BJP.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Since the INC occupies a dominant position in the presidential electoral college, the media and the general public all speculate that Patil is rather likely to be elected.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Patil, currently 72 years old, was a woman governor of Rajasthan.</seg>
<seg id="8"> She was born into a lawyer's family and entered the parliament in 1985.  With rich experiences in politics, she was well acclaimed by the government during her tenure as governor of Rajasthan.</seg>
<seg id="9"> In addition she is devoted to the social welfare and is the honorary chairperson of many cultural, educational, and social welfare organizations.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Analysts pointed out that the reason why Patil became a candidate is because she has remained loyal to the INC president Sonia Gandhi.</seg>
<seg id="11"> In India the Gandhi family has controlled the ruling INC party for a long time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Patil is supported and respected by a large number of female voters.  Female voters believe that Patil will reshape the image of women and raise the status of women in India, where discrimination against females is a dominant ideology.</seg>

<seg id="3"> A long-term follow-up research by glacier experts at the Swiss Academy of Sciences found that from 1850 to 2005 the 1,800 plus glaciers in Switzerland were shrinking at an annual rate of 3%.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The heat wave in 2003 alone caused the Alps glacier to melt by 1.8%</seg>
<seg id="5"> Experts believe that if the global temperature rises by 3 degrees Celsius by 2100, the glaciers will have shrunk by 80% compared with the present and that with a temperature rise of 5 degrees Celsius, the glaciers will have entirely melted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The Aletsch glacier is the longest glacier in Europe and has been inscribed on the list of the UNESCO Natural World Heritage.  However, from 2005 to 2006, it shrank by 100 meters within a year.  There can be no more delay in protecting the natural environment.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> On July 1, the Eternal Warning Bell in the Memorial Hall of Nanjing's Jinghai Temple was tolled once again, the sound of the bell ringing melodiously.</seg>
<seg id="3"> This rich echo of history connected the mainland and Hong Kong via television, as the citizens of Nanjing and Hong Kong compatriots "shared the same occasion from the far corners of the earth" and celebrated together the tenth anniversary of Hong Kong's reversion to the motherland.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Ten years previously, at 12:00 a.m. on July 1, the sound of the tolling of the Eternal Warning Bell reverberated 155 times in the sky over the bell tower of the Memorial Hall of Nanjing's Jinghai Temple, bidding farewell to the humiliating history of the cession of Hong Kong island.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> People from all walks of life in Nanjing society gathered together in front of the gate of the smallish Memorial Hall.  They said that they wanted to give an eternal warning to themselves and to later generations not to forget history by ringing this Eternal Warning Bell with their own two hands.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> "The bell of the Eternal Warning Bell is 1.842 meters high, and the year 1842 was precisely when the 'Nanjing Treaty' was concluded at the time of the eruption of the Opium War.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The shoulder of the bell is 1.997 meters high, and 1997 was the year of Hong Kong's reversion."</seg>
<seg id="8"> The man behind the devising and casting of the Eternal Warning Bell that year, Wang Fengling, explained that "there are five 'wan' character inscriptions around the body of the bell.  The whole copper bell is in high relief, with two dragons supporting a fireball, symbolizing the fact that Hong Kong is the motherland's 'Pearl of the Orient.'  Finally, Nanjing's city flower, the plum blossom, forms the pattern on the body of the bell where the bell is struck."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Yu Xiaodong, a member of the Democratic Party and the first person back then to propose the construction of the Eternal Warning Bell sighed with emotion, saying, "Before we knew it, it has been ten years already since the reversion of Hong Kong."  He hopes that Hong Kong's tomorrow could be like the sound of that tolling bell, "resounding and melodious, ongoing and everlasting."</seg>

<seg id="1"> Russia's Security Service Accuses Exiled Oligarch Berezovsky of "Plotting to Launch a Coup d'Etat"</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A lawyer for Berezovsky, the Russian oligarch in exile in London, Borovkov, announced on July 2 that the Russian Federal Security Service had formally issued a new charge against his client, accusing Berezovsky of "plotting to engineer a coup d'Ã©tat and attempting a violent seizure of political power in Russia."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Borovkov pointed out that in April this year Berezovsky had announced during an interview with a journalist from the British "Guardian" newspaper that he was preparing to launch a "palace coup" in Russia, and confirmed that he was providing financial support to representatives of the right-wing elite opposed to the policies of the administration.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The Russian Federal Security Service's investigation bureau immediately launched a criminal investigation against Berezovsky under article 278 on "forcible seizure of power" of the Penal Code of the Russian Federation, and has formally brought forward related charges in Moscow's Savyolovsky court recently.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> It is reported that the Russian Procuratorate-General brought criminal charges against Berezovsky in February 2006, similarly based on the exiled oligarch's confirmation during an interview that he was attempting a seizure of state power by force in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="6"> As Berezovsky has remained in exile abroad, making it impossible to extradite him, Russia authorities temporarily suspended the investigation of the case in January 2007.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> On July 2, Moscow's Savyolovsky court began to hear another criminal case against the exiled oligarch.  The Russian Procuratorate-General accused Berezovsky of embezzling funds of 214 million roubles from Aeroflot and laundering 16 million roubles.  After the hearing the court decided to postpone judicial investigation into this case till July 12, and a state defense lawyer will be assigned for the defendant in this period.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Berezovsky believes that this is all a "farce," and has explicitly prohibited his defense lawyer from taking part in the court hearings.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Over the course of the current year, all departments in all parts of Guangxi have launched a movement to transform cadres' style of work and strengthen the building of administrative efficiency in official bodies, implementing the "three systems:" the "ask first" responsibility system, the time-limited case-handling system and the accountability system.   Thirty-three key approval departments directly under the autonomous region and 135 responsible posts have been brought into the administrative efficiency inspection work network.</seg>
<seg id="3"> So far, 619 people have been held to account.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> On the 5th this reporter learned from the Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region that Guangxi has currently formed a rudimentary administrative efficiency inspection work network at the autonomous region, municipality and county levels.  They are strengthening inspection of key departments and responsible posts, and the electronic inspection systems of 14 municipalities have been completely linked with that of the autonomous region.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The autonomous region's electronic system for the inspection of administrative efficiency is directly connected to 33 key approval departments directly under the autonomous region and 135 responsible posts that deal with the investment environment and the production and life of the masses,  further standardizing their approval behavior and raising their approval efficiency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> At the same time, all levels of Guangxi's discipline inspection supervision bodies are solemnly investigating cases that touch on the efficiency of workstyles or harm the interests of the people.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The secretary of the standing committee of Guangxi Autonomous Region's party committee and discipline inspection committee, Ma Tieshan, said on the 5th that inspection of administrative efficiency is a task that will accompany administrative activities from beginning to end, and it was necessary to gradually put in place a long-term and effective mechanism.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Guangxi is to further perfect and standardize all of its administrative management regulations and systems, and set up and perfect an administrative efficiency inspection work mechanism and safeguard system, so as to put efficiency inspection on an institutionalized  and standardized track; further standandize supervision and inspection procedures, strengthen and improve the complaint resolution mechanism and performance evaluation and assessment mechanism; step up accountability, and use a strict accountability system to ensure the practical implementation of the "ask first" responsibility system, the time-limited case-handling system, and other work systems.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> According to a report in the US media on the 15th, there has recently been a trend in the US towards a sharp increase in the number of reports of heart diseases and other adverse reactions caused by Avandia, an anti-diabetic medicine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> In May this year the US Food and Drug Administration issued a safety warning, recommending that sufferers from diabetes exercise caution when using Avandia, because a scientist had published a research report in the edition of the New England Journal of Medicine that came out on May 21, saying that this best-selling drug could greatly increase the incidence of and death rate from heart disease among sufferers.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Consequently, the safety of Avandia has received close attention by doctors and patients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Statistics show that in the approximately one month following the issuing of the safety warning, the US FDA had received 357 reports of adverse reactions caused by Avandia, of which 38 were reports of deaths.</seg>
<seg id="6"> And yet the FDA had received just 50 and 73 reports of adverse reactions in January and February this year respectively.</seg>
<seg id="7"> These adverse reactions ranged from being as trivial as getting blisters to as serious as sudden deaths from heart disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> However, the US FDA's pharmaceuticals experts believe that it would currently be premature to reach the conclusion that Avandia is not safe.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The FDA will hold a hearing into the safety of Avandia on July 30.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Avandia, which came on the market in 1999, is an insulin sensitizer, suitable for treating Type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Some 6 million diabetes sufferers worldwide have taken or are taking Avandia.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Avandia's producer, the British company GlaxoSmithKline, continues to believe that Avandia is safe, and that for suffers "the benefits outweigh the drawbacks."</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> An official in the US Department of Defense said on the 23rd that due to the Iraq war and changes in the world situation, the US Department of Defense is reconsidering a plan drawn up in 2002 to cut the number of US troops in Europe by approximately half.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The US media cited a Department of Defense official as saying that due to the ongoing Iraq war and the worsening US relations with Russia and Iran, Department of Defense leaders have raised doubts about the feasibility of plans to cut troops in Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In 2002 the then Secretary of Defense Rumsfield announced that the US would reduce troop numbers in Europe from the original 113,000 to 71,000 before 2012, in order to create a new-style army with "fewer, but better" soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The US army's total forces in Europe have currently fallen to 100,000 people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> But in June this year, Commander Craddock of the US Army Headquarters in Europe submitted a report to the current secretary of defense, Gates, raising doubts over the above-mentioned reduction plan.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The report said that while US army forces are being reduced in Europe, many military units would be deployed on a rotation basis to Iraq and Afghanistan for combat, leading to a shortfall in US troops in Europe to such an extent that there would be no way to develop normal cooperation with European allies.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The report recommended halting the plan to reduce US troops in Europe.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Three Main Functions of Modern Military Uniform</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The first is the identification function.</seg>
<seg id="3"> It is an important sign that distinguishes the armies of different countries, different military services, and between the military and civilians.</seg>
<seg id="4"> In the armies of more than 100 large and small countries of the world, although the use of military uniform is basically identical, there are no two countries' armies whose military uniforms are completely the same.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The second is the symbolic function.</seg>
<seg id="6"> To a certain extent, military uniform is both a reflection of a country's mental outlook and its national characteristics, and is also a concentrated embodiment of a country's military ability to wage war and the quality of its servicemen.</seg>
<seg id="7"> In the three main types of military uniform -- ceremonial attire, everyday uniforms, and drill uniforms -- the one that can express national prestige and military prestige to the fullest extent is none other than ceremonial attire that is well-pressed and pleasing to the eye.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The third is the protective function.</seg>
<seg id="9"> With the rapid development of high-tech and updated weaponry, improving the overall protective capacity of new-style drill uniforms to give military uniform various types of functions -- including bulletproofing, stealth protection, anti-chemical, anti-bacterial and anti-radiation functions, as well as control of the temperature, humidity and the air -- has become a key issue in the development of military uniform.</seg>

<seg id="1"> A Brigade Party Committee Organ Has the Courage to Handle Thorny Issues Properly</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Staff Writer, Chengdu, July 3</seg>
<seg id="3"> Report by Qu Yimao and Yang Ruiyu: "We can now move into apartments as a result of the brigade party committee organ's resolution and boldness in freeing up the apartments."</seg>
<seg id="4"> Today, more than ten cadres in a communications drill brigade in Chengdu Military Command were all beaming with pleasure as they moved into apartments.  They felt full of admiration and gratitude for the way the "group" on the brigade party committee dared to confront tough obstacles in solving thorny issues.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Over the past few years, along with the replacement of personnel, an excessive part of the brigade's accommodation for family members had been occupied against regulations, making it difficult to house the cadres on active duty.  Officers and men had quite strong views about this.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The brigade had tried to free up the apartments several times, but failed to get it done each time due to all kinds of obstruction, allowing the problem to become a long-standing, big and difficult issue.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "As long as we have the courage to do things properly and are fair and reasonable, there are no difficulties we cannot solve."</seg>
<seg id="8"> After the group on the new party committee had reached a consensus, the principal leaders appeared in person and set about thoroughly sorting out all the problems relating to occupation of apartments against regulations.</seg>
<seg id="9"> On the one hand they appealed to people's emotions and explained their reasoning, hoping that the personnel concerned would consider the whole picture; on the other hand, they explained the policies and regulations relating to military apartments, apartments built with pooled money, and economical and adequate apartments, to show the party committee's staunch determination and principled stance.</seg>
<seg id="10"> In the case of personnel who had accommodation elsewhere and were not willing to leave the additional apartments they occupied, the party committee organ promptly made contact with the work units they were in and adopted relevant measures to encourage them to take the initiative in cooperating with the work of the army.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Over two months of meticulous work, all residents occupying additional apartments in the army barracks against regulations had all moved out on schedule, and cadres who worked in the brigade were all assigned the accommodation in accordance with regulations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The way in which this brigade party committee dared to confront tough obstacles has also given rise to a chain reaction.  Several cadres who originally were unwilling to actively cooperate with the organization's allotment have now one by one also expressed their willingness to obey the organization's decisions.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Staff Writer,  Beijing, July 13  Report by Yang Baojin and Correspondent Liu Xinxin: The whole of the army will change into 07-series military uniforms in succession from August 1.</seg>
<seg id="3"> This evening, China Military Online has specially invited Chen Jun, the deputy director of the Clothing and Equipment Office of the Military Supplies and Fuel Division of the General Logistics Department, and Su Yang, senior engineer in the Military Supplies Equipment Research Office of the General Logistics Department and one of the designers of the 07-series military uniforms, to be its guests at China Military Online, and engage in free discussions with netizens both in and outside the army on the background to the development of the new military uniforms and the manufacturing process, provoking a response from the netizens.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The two honored guests directly took part in the design and manufacture of the 07-series military uniforms.</seg>
<seg id="5"> While discussing the changes in the new uniforms, they explained that the 07-series uniforms were designed on the basis of previous uniform changes, in particular, the 97-series uniforms, and had made improvements in seven areas, including the uniform series, standards, and styles, totaling hundreds of items.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The greatest feature of the 07-series uniforms is that it has reflected the requirements for serialization, functionalization and personalization, allowing our army's military uniform to achieve standards in terms of coordination among the three armed services, completeness of varieties and the way the series forms a set for the first time.  This signifies the realization of a historical leap in the level of our army's military uniform development.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The two honored guests also carried out wide-ranging exchanges with the netizens on issues such as the new uniforms' types, styles, specifications, and accessories.</seg>

<seg id="1"> People's Armed Force Department in Jingjiang City Sets up a Platform to Raise the Quality of Their Full-time Cadres</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Staff Writer, Report by Cao Jiawei and Zhu Chunbin: On June 18, at a training class for People's Armed Force full-time cadres in Jingjiang city in Jiangsu province, Lu Yuqing, leader of the People's Armed force department of Xilai township, delivered a training lecture "Winning a Psychological War under Informationalized Conditions" that received a unanimous favorable assessment from the trainees.</seg>
<seg id="3"> This was a new change that was brought about by the city's People's Armed Force when it has put more pressure on its cadres based on the reality of their positions in an effort to raise People's Armed Force cadres' comprehensive quality.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> At the beginning of this year, the People's Armed force party committee discovered during investigation and research at the grassroots level that some of the People's Armed Force cadres had served for a long time, had too many concurrent duties, and had not put their chief energies into the armed force work.</seg>
<seg id="5"> For this reason, they have adopted methods including centralized training, replacing training with meetings, and relying on local party schools to conduct training, thus regularly training military cadres, in an effort to resolve problems such as the narrow knowledge base and the uniform focus of the professional quality of military cadres.</seg>
<seg id="6"> In combination with the central work, they boldly assign tasks to military cadres and put more pressure on them, and raise their performance by on-the-job training.</seg>
<seg id="7"> At the same time, they have actively coordinated with local organizational departments and jointly drafted the "People's Armed Forces Cadres' Competition for Jobs Scheme," and explicitly stipulated that the leaders of People's Armed Forces departments must join the party committee of the same level and cannot concurrently take on other jobs.</seg>
<seg id="8"> They have set up a military cadres' restructuring exchange mechanism to promptly regulate exchanges on some older military cadres who are not suitable for grassroots People's Armed forces work, and promote and use some comrades of good comprehensive quality and strong work ability.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Not long ago, a domestic gap was filled by the underwater boat-welding technology invented and developed by the People's Militia technology platoon under the leadership of the secretary of the armed department of the New Century Shipbuilding Company Limited, Chen Yisong, who was exceptionally promoted as the company's armed department leader.</seg>

<seg id="1"> When You Start Well, You Still Need to Finish Well</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Judging simply from the result of the match, 2-2 seems a reasonable score, and is also one that the Chinese team can accept.  The key problem is that the way the match went made people feel it was rather a pity.</seg>
<seg id="3"> If the Iranian team had taken a 2-0 lead, then the Chinese team had evened up the score, then the feeling that would have given China's sports fans would certainly have been different.  It would have boosted morale.  The pity was that the situation was precisely the opposite.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> You could say that starting well but being unable to finish well is an old problem of the Chinese team.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The Chinese team often don't kick the ball when they have an excellent chance, and most people's view is that the psychological quality of China's players is not really up to it.</seg>
<seg id="6"> This is actually one reason why the Chinese team cannot "finish well."</seg>
<seg id="7"> However, judging by the Chinese team's match today, it may not be quite so.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Even if we set aside the fact that Sun Jihai, Sun Xiang, Shao Jiayi, Zheng Zhi and others have played in Europe, Li Weifeng and others are also old-timers with long experience of the battlefield.  They have experience and knowledge, and so it would be reasonable to say that there should not be any problem with their psychological quality.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The reason why the Chinese team was regrettably forced to a draw by the Iranian team this time may be because they deployed their forces in a lackadaisical manner at key points of the match.</seg>
<seg id="10"> When the Iranian team were behind, they substituted two persons, and the scene immediately seemed different.</seg>
<seg id="11"> In the second half, the Chinese team also substituted three players, but without a positive effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> To overcome the problem of starting well but being unable to finish well, it is definitely necessary to pinpoint the source of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="13"> As long as the problem is correctly grasped, it will probably not be difficult to find a way to get rid of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="14"> The worst thing when you have a serious illness is just to go to see any doctor.</seg>
<seg id="15"> If they carry on like this, no matter how many matches the Chinese team play, the old problem will still continue, and the constant progress with every game that everyone expects will be out of the question.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Staff Writer, Shenzhen, July 18</seg>
<seg id="3"> Report by Li Guoliang and Huang Qi: For many years, Guangdong's Frontier Defense Unit Hospital, while doing a good job ensuring army medical service, has also done all it can to aid the masses who have found themselves in straitened circumstances, their compassion soothing the hearts of the common people everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="4"> This morning, a celebratory meeting to mark the conferring by the Public Security Ministry of a Collective Ward of Merit, Second Class, on Guangdong's Frontier Defense Unit Hospital, together with a public lecture on the exemplary deeds of the army in supporting the government and cherishing the people, was solemnly held in Shenzhen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The Guangdong Frontier Unit Hospital, which has set itself the task of building socialist harmony, has successively established three fair-price hospitals specially aimed at migrant laborers in Buji, Longhua and Bao'an of Shenzhen.  The registration fee for migrant laborers seeking medical advice is only 1 yuan, and discounts of 20% are available for both tests and operations.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The hospital is provided with a special "Compassionate Service Vehicle," which takes peasant migrant patients to and from the clinic free of charge, and has rolled out a migrant peasant worker "Health Service Card," whereby each person needs to pay just 7 yuan a month to enjoy 12 types of basic medical treatment consultations and guarantees.</seg>
<seg id="7"> These measures to benefit the people have already been extended to more than 12,000 migrant peasant workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Since 2003, the hospital has also launched large-scale compassionate charity consultation events under the title "Lighting a Thousand Lamps," and has organized eight successive trips to send ophthalmic doctors and nurses to distant places such as Tibet, Jiangxi, Yunnan, and Qinghai to "bring light and health," performing nearly 3,000 cataract operations free of charge, helping sufferers to see again.</seg>

<seg id="3"> Today, this correspondent saw from the launch ceremony of the Armed Police 07-series uniform and the dressing demonstration event that the current uniform change altogether includes 105 types of clothing in four main categories, namely ceremonial attire, everyday uniform, drill uniform, and symbols and accessories.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The color of the uniform is being adjusted from the current olive green to deep olive green.  Ornamental trim is being sewn on all sleeve cuffs and pant side hems.

<seg id="6"> The newly added name tags, rank and qualifications badges, national defense military service badges and ribbons, as well as redesigned cap insignia, chest symbols, tie toggles, epaulets and sleeve insignia have strengthened the identification function of the clothing and improved its esthetic appearance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The Armed Police will be issued with their 07-series uniform over 3 years.</seg>
<seg id="8"> By August 1, 2007, police officers, civilian cadres and the National Flag Guard, military orchestras, and song-and-dance troupes will be issued with their ceremonial attire in keeping with the entire military.

<seg id="1"> "Small, Scattered, Far and Direct" Education Coordination Zones Go into Operation in a Second Artillery Unit Base</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Staff Writer, Report by Xue Bingjian and Correspondent Xu Yeqing: The situation in the "small, scattered, far and direct" units where education organization is difficult, resources are meager, and each fends for itself, will become history at a second artillery unit base.</seg>
<seg id="3"> This correspondent learned recently that following a half-year pilot project, this base has handed down "The Method of Fully Implementing 'An Outline for Ideological and Political Education'."  A number of ideological and political education coordination zones covering all the "small, scattered, far and direct" units in the base have officially been brought into operation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In order to push ahead with the effective implementation of "An Outline for Ideological and Political Education," the base organized resources at the beginning of the year to conduct in-depth investigation and research of the ideological and political education situation in "small, scattered, far and direct" units.  They combed through important issues that influence and restrict the education time, personnel and results, and initially established this new-style education model of coordination zones for the "small, scattered, far and direct" units.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The concrete approach of coordination zones is to break down the organizational boundaries among units and set up a brigade and regiment-level unit to take the lead in the areas where the "small, scattered, far and direct" units are relatively concentrated, and conduct an integrated program for thematic education, with units falling under different hierarchies coming together in nearby places for lectures or using the help of video link-up systems for remote discussions.</seg>
<seg id="6"> They have adopted a method that integrates taking turns in giving lessons and competing for posts, and unifying the allocation of educational resources.  In each area the use of educational hardware will be integrated, and each unit's materials, data and educational experiences will be shared and exchanged with those of others, with regular organization in each area of typical tour reports and exchanges of what they got from the study by the officers and men.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Every coordination zone has set up a devoted educational liaison person and a part-time educational information gatherer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> On this basis, each coordination zone has also set up systems for seeking assistance on difficult issues, holding joint discussions on major educational themes, reporting critical ideological situations, and assessing tests and evaluations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Zhang Shengmin, the director of the base's political department, told this correspondent that constructing political education coordination zones has both reduced the waste of educational resources and deepened the impact of education.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Some political instructors fear they will lose marks in front of officers and men from other units and have taken the initiative to study new things and seek new educational methods.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The officers and men receiving the education have also enthusiastically digested the educational content, out of concern over expressing themselves in layman's language in front of the officers and men of friendly neighboring units during discussion and analysis.</seg>
<seg id="12"> In this way, the enthusiasm of the people giving and receiving education has been both effectively stimulated.</seg>

<seg id="3"> Luo Xiangming, an NCO class, happily told this writer, "That the brigade's leaders care about and cherish the sailors deeply moves us.  After a period of rest and recuperation, we will definitely work doubly hard!"</seg>

<p>
<seg id="4"> This is actually the first time that this brigade has organized rest and recuperation for grassroots sailors.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Not long ago, the brigade commander Yao Qingsheng went down to the grassroots units and saw that sailors responsible for repair work were braving high temperatures to carry out equipment maintenance and repair work, deeply moving Yao Qingsheng.</seg>
<seg id="6"> "As the sailors work selflessly, the party committee should care about and cherish the sailors, and take responsibility for the sailors' health."  At a meeting of the party committee, Yao Qingsheng's words were endorsed by everyone.</seg>
<seg id="7"> After looking into the matter, the party committee reached a decision to give the entire R&R quota allocated to the brigade by senior authorities to the sailors doing repair work on the frontline.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Staff Writer</seg>
<seg id="3"> Report by Wang Weiqin and Specially Contracted Correspondent Li Deying: On July 25, this writer observed in a service support company of the Ji'nan Military Command that invitations for an army engineering tender, details of financial expenditure, promotions of cadres, non-commissioned officers being admitted to the Party and other major matters were written up on a bulletin board, and hung up conspicuously in a display cabinet.</seg>
<seg id="4"> As Political Commissar Su Chengsen explained, this is a concrete measure adopted by the section to promote a system where things are done openly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> At the beginning of this year, the unit party committee drew up measures including "Two-way Supervision Between the Organization and the Grassroots" and "Publicizing Sensitive Issues" to strengthen the construction of the party spirit and honest government, requiring that for all significant issues that involve the direct interests of the officers and men and army development, the opinions of grassroots officers and men are first heard before decisions are reached, and that standards, procedures, and results etc of the handling of the matters are made public from start to finish in line with the circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The unit has installed a suggestion box and a bulletin board, and has opened a "message board" on its Intranet to collect everyone's views and recommendations in an extensive way.</seg>
<seg id="7"> At the beginning of the year, as the renovation project of the soldiers' barracks was about to start, before the work began, the party committee organ extensively solicited the views of the officers and men, and then released the information on inviting bids, implementing a system of open tenders.</seg>
<seg id="8"> This both saved money and won the support of the officers and men.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Doing things in an open and fair way has driven the formation of a good atmosphere at the grassroots.</seg>
<seg id="10"> In this unit, the grassroots company insists on making regular public announcements and notices, no matter whether they are issues as big as the determination of "hot-button" sensitive matters, or as trivial as personal vacations to visit relatives or daily income and expenditure in the mess accounts, thus taking the initiative to receive the supervision of the masses.</seg>

<seg id="3"> According to a report in the latest issue of Nature magazine, after researchers at Iceland's deCode Genetics Inc sifted through the genes of thousands of people from Iceland, Sweden, and the US, as well as China's Hong Kong region, they made the above-mentioned discovery.</seg>

<seg id="1"> (Sports) Veteran US Goalkeeper Keller May Retire after America's Cup</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Maracaibo (Venezuela) July 3 (Correspondent Liu Jian)</seg>
<seg id="3"> According to a report in the Venezuelan media on the 3rd, the US team's 37-year-old veteran goalkeeper, Keller, said during an interview here that if he could not find a suitable club to serve in after the America's Cup, then he would opt to retire.</seg>
<seg id="4"> "If I have not been able to get a contract for 1-2 seasons with a high-quality league team within four to six weeks of the conclusion of the America's Cup, then maybe retiring will not be a bad choice for me."</seg>
<seg id="5"> With the relegation of the MÃ¶chengladbach team to the 2nd Bundesliga, Keller also left this soccer team in which he had served for more than two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Although Keller has a mind to retire, he has many opportunities and clearly need not worry about finding a place.  He himself has frankly stated that there are currently as many as eight soccer teams that are interested in inviting him to join them.</seg>
<seg id="7"> However, this veteran goalkeeper who has served in league matches for the Spanish Primera Liga, the English Premiership, and the German Bundesliga, said that what he ultimately chooses to do will be decided by his family.  "My kid is already 9 years old.

<seg id="9"> In the current America's cup, he has, just as before, been given an important job to do by head coach Bradley, but he clearly cannot win the match singlehanded.  The US team, made up of "young guards," is no match for such strong South American opponents as Argentina and Paraguay, and during these two matches the goal he guarded was breached seven times.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> With the hope of breaking the stalemate in the Doha Round of trade talks, key WTO negotiation representatives today proposed a large cut in farm subsidies by the US and a sharp reduction in industrial product import tariffs by developing countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> An official said that the new "draft model" demands that the US reduce its annual farm subsidies from the current allowed amount of US$19 billion to US$16.2 billion, and for developing countries to adjust industrial product import tariffs down to less than 23%.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> These proposals aim to break the almost six years of stalemate in the Doha Round of talks, and to help the 150 WTO members come to a compromise agreement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> WTO Secretary Lamy called these proposals "a fair and reasonable foundation for concluding a balanced and development-oriented agreement that has ambitious goals."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Lamy said, "Member countries will not be completely satisfied with the content of the proposals, but currently there are fewer problems concerning differences than problems creating consensus."</seg>

<p>
<seg id="7"> Suzuki Auto said that it would partially suspend production for three days starting tomorrow.  Japan's Fuji Heavy Industries, which produces Subaru vehicles, will also suspend production of small cars starting tomorrow and assess the situation on the 21st.</seg>

<seg id="3"> After the hearing, the official FIA website issued a statement saying, "The Vodafone McLaren Mercedes team was in possession of confidential Ferrari information, but there is currently insufficient evidence to prove that this information was improperly used for the FIA Formula One World Championship.  We'll therefore impose no penalty."</seg>

<p>
<seg id="4"> However, the Ferrari technology spy case does not end with this.</seg>
<seg id="5"> In this decision, the World Motor Sport Council also said, "If it is found in the future that relevant Ferrari information has been used to the detriment of the championship, we reserve the right to call McLaren back to a World Motor Sport Council hearing, where they could face punishment of disqualification from not only the 2007 season, but also the 2008 season."</seg>

<seg id="1"> Experts Believe: QDII Insurers Will Not Divert Domestic Stock Market Capital in Near Future</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Chinanews.com, July 30</seg>
<seg id="3"> According to a China Securities Journal report, with the introduction of the Provisional Measures for Administration of Outbound Investment of Insurance Funds a few days ago, insurance funds have more space to utilize the capital markets.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Liu Lefei, chief investment officer of China Life Insurance Co. Ltd., believes that with Renminbi appreciation and positive trends in domestic capital markets, insurance institutions in the near future will not make large-scale overseas investments with foreign exchange purchases.  This also indicates that QDII insurers will not divert domestic stock market capital in the near future.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The report said that many insurance institutions share the same view.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Experts believe that as there is currently no market for Renminbi derivatives, insurance institutions have insufficient means of avoiding risk.  As a result, it is not time yet for large-scale foreign exchange purchases.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Liu Lefei said that in terms of capital allocation, outbound investment should make up a certain ratio of overall allocations for insurance companies in the long run.</seg>
<seg id="8"> However, in view of relatively strong pressure for Renminbi appreciation at present, China Life will mainly use its own foreign exchange funds for outbound investments.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Foreign exchange purchases for outbound investment should be handled carefully under the current situation.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> On July 29, the Office of State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters made emergency arrangements targeted at the current difficult flood control and drought relief situation,</seg>
<seg id="5"> requesting the various provinces along the Huai River and the Huai River Prevention Headquarters to augment dispatches, to strengthen the guarding of dikes during receding-water periods, for achieving complete success in Huai River flood control and flood fighting work.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Chinanews.com, July 31 - On the 30th, Chen Shuibian questioned an attempt by the island's judicial personnel to interfere with the election of the Taiwan region's leaders.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Taiwan's "Department of Judicial Administration Director-General" Kao Chin-chih said on the same day that the current performance of the island's judges does not match what Chen Shuibian said, and requested that Chen Shuibian explain what he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to a report from Taiwan's United Daily News, on the 30th Chen Shuibian questioned interference, influence, and even attempts to control the election activities of the various parties' candidates, due to political factors or election considerations, by judges, public prosecutors, or investigators.  He claimed he hopes that this phenomenon does not exist in Taiwan, but that it might be very difficult.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In response to Chen Shuibian's questioning, Taiwanese "Judicial Yuan President" Weng Yueh-sheng kept a low profile and did not respond.  "Secretary-General" Fan Kuang-chun, on the other hand, assigned Kao Chin-chih to speak on behalf of the "Judicial Yuan."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Kao Chin-chih said that both the Taiwanese constitution and the "Judges' Rules" proclaim in writing that judges must be nonpartisan, cannot participate in political party activities, and cannot assist in elections; judges abide by the relevant restrictions very carefully.  The "Judicial Yuan" believes the judges are all doing a good job.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Kao Chin-chih gave an example, noting that Judge Jang Shenq-shii of Kaohsiung "Branch High Court" participated a few years ago in a course conducted by the Ketagalan School, and was punished because the course was tainted by a political party.  The punishment resolution was by a self-disciplinary committee composed of judges.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Jang Shenq-shii once wanted to take part in DPP primary elections, and eventually decided to give up because there was controversy over his election participation while working.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Kao Chin-chih thinks that if the ruling of an individual case can be appealed to a higher court for relief, it cannot be inferred that a judge has political motives based only on whether the ruling is a win or a loss.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Germany Plans to Lower Barriers for Bringing in Specialized Skilled Workers</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Staff report, Berlin, July 1 (Correspondent Wang Huaicheng)</seg>
<seg id="3"> German Education and Research Minister Schavan said a few days ago that Germany should lower the Immigration Law restrictions on bringing in foreign specialized skilled workers, using an introduction of foreign talent to solve Germany's specialized skilled worker shortage problems.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to an OECD report, by 2010, Germany's labor force between 15 and 64 years old will be shrinking yearly.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Without enough immigrants, Germany's labor force by 2020 will be 6% smaller than now.</seg>
<seg id="6"> However, reports from organizations such as the Federation of German Employers' Associations and the Association for German Engineers show that there is a relatively large shortage in the current German labor market for engineers and specialized technology workers.</seg>
<seg id="7"> According to data from the German Federal Labor Agency, the German labor market had a supply shortage of about 12,700 engineers and a supply shortage of about 9,600 technicians in May of this year.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Germany has set high barriers for the introduction of foreign skilled workers in order to protect local employment.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Germany's Immigration Law states that specialized skilled workers from non-EU countries cannot earn less than 85,500 euros per year in Germany, or else cannot obtain German work and residency permits.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Schavan proposed bringing this limit down to between 40,000 and 60,000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Don't Believe Blindly in the "Theoretical Field" of Law</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Clause 8 of the revised draft of the Law on Lawyers, which was recently submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for review, states: Those who have undertaken specialized work such as legal research or teaching and had a high-level title or the equivalent, upon application to become a lawyer can be allowed to practice law after examination and verification by the State Council's judicial administrative department.</seg>
<seg id="3"> (June 28, China Youth Daily)</seg>
<seg id="4"> In law, there is the "theoretical field" and the "practical field."  The former mainly includes "abstract actions" such as legal teaching and research work, while the latter undertakes more "concrete actions" such as litigation, legal consultation, and legal services.</seg>
<seg id="5"> For a long time, "intellectual disparagement" has existed between the "theoretical field" and "practical field" of law.  The "theoretical field" thinks that the "practical field" lacks necessary accomplishment in the law and are only mechanical "legalists"; meanwhile, the response of the "practical field" to criticism by the "theoretical field" is "theory cannot guide practice."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Concerning this kind of division of labor gap, what the law can do is stay neutral instead of giving strong support to either side.</seg>
<seg id="7"> However, the "specially licensed lawyer system" in the Law on Lawyers objectively recognizes a judgment that the law's "theoretical field" is above the law's "practical field."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The fact is that some experts and scholars who are engaged in researching and teaching of pure legal theory, such as history of the legal system and international law, do not fit with practical law regardless of their depth of theoretical attainment.</seg>
<seg id="9"> In this way, for the law's "practical field," the "specially licensed lawyer system" no doubt opens a "bad door" which very negatively influences chaos in qualifications.</seg>
<seg id="10"> This is not the only blind belief about the "theoretical field."  The phenomenon of expert opinions and expert panel discussions frequently influencing and even overruling court rulings is another direct manifestation of this kind of blind belief.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Do Not Let Peddlers Spoil Public Places</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> When out on a trip, one wants to feel relaxed, refreshed, and free, enjoying to the utmost the fruits of natural scenery and society's civilization.</seg>
<seg id="3"> However, many people encounter this kind of vexation when traveling domestically: being chased and intercepted by peddlers and middlemen in public places.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Whether on autos or trains, boarding or alighting, there are constant entanglements with small peddlers and some unlicensed middlemen.</seg>
<seg id="5"> If they are not selling eggs, peanuts, or sesame seed cakes, they are selling newspapers and magazines.  There are also many unlicensed middlemen introducing restaurants and hotels, even peddling fake certificates and fake receipts, among other things.</seg>
<seg id="6"> If you do not accept, he can chase you for a few hundred meters, like someone ready to die for a just cause in the face of failure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> At some scenic spots, many tourists also have the same feeling.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Prior to entering the main gate, people come to peddle things like travel souvenirs and small crafts.</seg>
<seg id="9"> After entering, there is more of this kind of situation.  No matter how good your mood, you will be bothered to the point of losing interest.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Media have reported that many foreign tourists in Xi'an sing endless praise for the scenic spots and historic sites of Xi'an, but cannot understand why masses of small peddlers and hawkers are allowed to sell everywhere.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Public places including bus stations and scenic spots are at root places for trips and relaxation.  They should be civilized, orderly, quiet, harmonious, providing tourists a comfortable and relaxed environment.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Peddlers' freedom to come and go not only affects the mood of tourists, it also destroys the public order of these public places on an objective level, bringing about visual pollution and environmental pollution.  At the same time, it also gives lawless people the condition and opportunity for creating trouble.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The important thing is, these public places are windows onto the development of local spiritual civilization.  One can deduce much from little information.  It is not only the image that suffers, as local economic development will be influenced as well.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Just think, you want to make the tourism industry bigger and stronger, but use this kind of chaotic tourism environment to welcome guests from near and far.  Who still wants to come?  Who dares to come?</seg>
<seg id="15"> How can your tourism economy obtain beneficial results?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> With the coming of the peak travel season, it should be said that creating a civilized travel environment for tourists from near and far is an urgent matter.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Public places are not markets.  The operating behavior of small peddlers and hawkers should be standardized.  Put a firm stop to unlicensed operations, staunchly crack down on illegal activities.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Only a civilized and orderly environment can let tourists come happily, leave satisfied, and return with excitement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> In short, do not let peddlers spoil public places.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Jianguomen neighborhood in Dongcheng District, Beijing, gave items such as refrigerators as a reward to 12 poor families who exited from subsistence allowances on their own initiative.</seg>
<seg id="3"> (Beijing News, July 10)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> This writer feels happy for the improved lives of these families, but has mixed feelings about the phrase "self-initiated exit from subsistence allowances," and the practice of "giving rewards."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> An assistant director of the Jianguomen neighborhood said, "In light of problems like cheating on subsistence allowances, encouraging the self-initiated exit from subsistence allowances sets an example for other poor families."</seg>
<seg id="6"> This example is indeed worth promoting if it encourages other poor people to get out of their predicaments through one's own hard work; it is really somewhat naÃ¯ve if it is thought this will "inspire" those people who have fraudulently received subsistence allowances for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="7"> When differentiating and straightening out real and fake poor families, what should be relied on more is the law.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Relevant departments should strengthen the obligations that must be met for poor families to enjoy subsistence allowances: such as immediately reporting changes in family members' incomes, reporting employment situation, and accepting regular reviews.  Meanwhile, relevant departments should increase the strength of supervision and investigation.</seg>
<seg id="9"> In the end, "exit from subsistence allowance according to the law" is the long-term solution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Who pays when the neighborhood gives material rewards to families who exit from subsistence allowance?</seg>
<seg id="11"> As a first-level governmental organization, a neighborhood has its expenses covered by financial allocations.</seg>
<seg id="12"> However, should this taxpayer money be spent?</seg>
<seg id="13"> On the one hand, families who exit from subsistence allowances prove that they already have a certain "self-sufficient" capacity; on the other hand, aren't there still people who are applying for subsistence allowances?</seg>
<seg id="14"> Government financial allocations, which is called a lifeline, should provide timely help rather than reward good fortune.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> On July 10, Chengdu City Xindu District Mulan Town Party Committee Secretary Liu Gangyi, the first town party committee secretary in the country to be directly elected by the public, received his fourth review since taking office, achieving a satisfaction rate of 97%.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Liu Gangyi positioned himself as a "service provider" during a conversation between this correspondent and Liu Gangyi.</seg>
<seg id="4"> (Yesterday, Beijing News)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> "Service provider" in the words of Liu Gangyi may be more real, more convincing than "service provider" in the words of some appointed cadres.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The biggest advantage of being directly elected by the public compared to appointment is that for the former, determination of power mainly originates with ordinary party members and the public, whereas for the latter, nominations are mainly by superior organizations.  Therefore, direction of the power source determines that with the former, responsibility to the public must be given top priority.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The source of power, and to whom one owes responsibility, are basic elements that determine how elected people carry out their work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Some people question whether such "democratic review" is more like a "democracy show."</seg>
<seg id="9"> My opinion is, having this kind of "democratic review" format is better than nothing.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Considering the history and current situation of China's grassroots democratic political development, I think direct election by the public is already a major breakthrough.  Democratic review is an important component of this pioneering work, and should not be underestimated in promoting grassroots democratic political development.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> On June 23, Patil clasped her hands together before filling out the presidential candidate documents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> India's presidential election kicked off on the 19th, with the new president to be elected from between Shekhawat, the current vice president, and Pratibha Patil, the recently resigned governor of Rajasthan state.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Patil is the first female presidential candidate in the history of India.  If she is elected, she will become the first female president in India's history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Patil is the presidential candidate for the governing Congress Party, whereas Shekhawat comes from the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Since the Congress Party has an advantage in the presidential electoral college, the media and public largely guess that the possibility of a Patil victory is higher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Patil, who is 72 years old this year, was Rajasthan's female governor.</seg>
<seg id="8"> She started out as a lawyer, entering parliament in 1985.  With abundant political work experience, she received high opinions from the government when governor of Rajasthan.</seg>
<seg id="9"> She has also dedicated herself for social welfare, as honorary chairwoman for many cultural, educational, and social welfare organizations.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Analysts note that Patil became a candidate as a result of her unswerving loyalty to Sonia Ghandi, president of India's Congress Party.</seg>
<seg id="11"> In India, the Ghandi family has been controlling the governing Congress Party for a long time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Patil has received many female voters' support.  Female voters believe that in India where there is a strong concept of discrimination against women, Patil will remold the image of women and raise the status of women.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The constitution stipulates that the president of India, a federal country, is the country's leader and commander-in-chief of the armed forces in name, without representing any party or organization.  It is more of a symbol.</seg>

<seg id="3"> This echo of profound historical significance "connected" the Mainland and Hong Kong through television; citizens of Nanjing and their fellow countrymen in Hong Kong "shared this moment with the entire world" together celebrating the 10th anniversary of Hong Kong's handover to the motherland.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> At midnight on July 1 ten years ago, the air above the bell tower at Jinghai temple memorial in Nanjing reverberated to the sounds of one hundred and fifty-five strikes of the alarm bell.  It was saying adieu to the humiliating history of the cession of Hong Kong Island.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Outside the entrance to the small memorial hall, people from all walks of society in Nanjing gathered together.  They said they will use their own two hands to strike this alarm bell, to warn themselves and later generations never to forget history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The alarm bell is 1.842 meters high and it was in 1842 that the "Nanjing Treaty" was signed, right at the time the Opium War broke out.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The shoulder of the bell is 1.997 meters high and 1997 is the year of the Hong Kong handover.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The planner and founder of the alarm bell that year, Wang Fengling, explained, "Five rows of the character 'Ten Thousand' encircle the body of the bell.  The entire bronze bell uses high relief sculpture and two dragons support a ball of fire which symbolizes that Hong Kong is the motherland's 'Pearl of the Orient.'  Finally, the flower of Nanjing city, plum blossom, is the figure on the bell's strikeplate."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The first member of the Democracy Party that year to propose making the alarm bell, Yu Xiaodong, said emotionally, "Before I realized it, it is already ten years since Hong Kong's return."  He hopes that Hong Kong's tomorrow can be like the sound of the bell, "bright and long, and stretching forever without end."</seg>

<seg id="1"> Russian Security Bureau Charges Exiled Oligarch Berezovksy with "Secretly Initiating a Political Coup"</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> On July 2, Borovkov, lawyer of the Russian oligarch Berezovsky exiled in London, announced that the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation has made a new formal charge accusing his client Berezovksky of "secretly planning a national political coup and attempting to violently take over Russian political authority. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Borovkov pointed out that in April this year, in an interview with a reporter from the British The Guardian, Berezovsky announced that he was prepared to initiate a "palace revolution" in Russia and confirmed that he provided financial support to the right wing elite representatives opposing the policies of the party in power.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Following this, the Investigation Office of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation launched a criminal investigation against Berezovsky according to article 278 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation,"seizing power through violence."  In the last few days they formally lodged a corresponding indictment with Moscow's Savyolovsky court.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Reports say that in February 2006 the Russian Federation Chief Prosecutors Office issued a criminal indictment against Berezovsky on the same premise that the exiled oligarch confirmed in an interview that he planned to take over political power in Russia by force.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Since Berezovsky has continuously been exiled abroad and could not be extradited, in January 2007 the Russians temporarily terminated investigation of this case.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> On July 2, Russia's Savyolovsky court commenced hearing another criminal case against the exiled oligarch.  The Russian Chief Prosecutors Office accused Berezovsky of embezzling 214 million Rubles from Aeroflot and laundering 16 million Rubles.  After hearing the evidence the court decided to adjourn until July 12 when they will launch a court investigation.  In the meantime, they will assign a state defense attorney to the accused.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Berezovsky believes this is all a "farce" and categorically forbids his defense attorney from taking part in the hearing.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> From this year, every department in each region of Guangxi has launched a campaign to change the working style of cadres and intensify construction of administrative efficiency in its organizations.  It implements "three systems:" the initial enquiry responsibility system, the handling formalities within time limits system, and the responsibility accountability system.  The key examination and approval departments affiliated to 33 autonomous regions and 135 positions of responsibility were brought into the administrative efficiency supervision work network.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Up until now, 619 people have been called to account.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> On the 5th, this correspondent learned from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Committee for Discipline Inspection that at present Guangxi has preliminarily formed a three tier, autonomous region, municipal and county administrative efficiency inspection work network to intensify supervision of the key departments and positions of responsibility.  An electronic monitoring system of 14 cities has been fully implemented in the autonomous region's network.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The autonomous region administrative efficiency electronic inspection system connects directly to the key examination and approval departments affiliated to 33 autonomous regions and 135 positions of responsibility that deal with the investment environment and the life and work of the people.  This has further standardized the conducting of examinations and approvals, as well as improved its efficiency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> At the same time, all levels of discipline inspection and monitoring organizations in Guangxi are strictly investigating and dealing with cases involving work style and efficiency, and damage to the public interest.  Up until now, a total of 1,104 cases have been verified and investigation results for 769 cases have been finalized; 584 work units and 619 people have been called to account.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Member of the standing committee of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Party Committee and Discipline Inspection Committee Secretary Ma Tieshan said on the 5th that administrative efficiency inspection is an item of work that will always remain concomitant with administrative activities and must be progressively formed into a longstanding and effective mechanism.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Guangxi must further perfect and standardize codes of practice for each item of administrative management, build a complete administrative efficiency monitoring work system and safeguarding mechanism, and bring efficiency monitoring on track of systemization and standardization.  It must further regulate monitoring and inspection procedures, build a complete complaint handling and performance efficiency evaluation and assessment mechanism, and significantly increase accountability efforts by using a strict accountability system to ensure that the initial enquiry responsibility system, the handling formalities within time limits system and other work systems are put fully into practice.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> According to US media reports on the 15th, the number of reports in the USA of heart disease and other adverse reactions caused by the anti-diabetes drug Avandia has recently seen a dramatic rise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The US Food and Drug Administration issued a safety warning in May this year suggesting that diabetes patients use Avandia cautiously, because scientists published a research report in the issue of New England Journal of Medicine published on May 21 that said this blockbuster drug will greatly increase the heart disease incidence rate and death rate of patients.</seg>
<seg id="4"> As a result, the safety of Avandia came under close scrutiny from doctors and patients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Statistics show within around one month of issuing the safety warning, the US FDA received 357 reports of adverse reactions caused by Avandia, of those 38 were fatality reports.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Whereas in January and February this year, the FDA received only 50 and 73 reports of adverse reactions respectively.</seg>
<seg id="7"> These adverse reactions were as minor as blistering and as major as sudden cardiac death.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> However, experts at the US FDA believe that now it is still early to arrive at the conclusion that Avandia is unsafe.</seg>
<seg id="9"> On July 30, the FDA will hold a hearing concerning the safety of Avandia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Introduced to the market in 1999, Avandia is a kind of insulin sensitizer suitable for the treatment of Type II diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="11"> In the entire world there are about six million diabetes patients who have taken or are taking Avandia.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Avandia's manufacturer, the British GlaxoSmithKline Company, has always considered that Avandia is safe and that for patients "the benefits are greater than the risks."</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A US Department of Defense official said on the 23rd that due to the Iraq war and the change in the world situation, the U.S. Department of Defense is currently reconsidering its plan, formulated in 2002, to cut the number of US troops posted in Europe by roughly half.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> US media quoted a Department of Defense official saying, because the Iraq war is still in progress and US relations with Russia and Iran have worsened, those at the leadership level of the Department of Defense questioned the viability of the plan to cut troops posted in Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In 2002, the Secretary of Defense at the time, Rumsfeld, announced that before 2012 the US will cut the number of troops posted in Europe from the original 113,000 people to 71,000 people, in order to build a "smaller but superior" new model army.</seg>
<seg id="5"> At present, the total military strength of the US Army posted in Europe has already been reduced to 100,000 people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> However, in June this year, Chief of Staff Craddock at US European Command Headquarter submitted a report to the current Secretary of Defense Gates, raising doubts about the abovementioned reduction plan.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The report said that while the military strength of US troops posted in Europe was being reduced, many of the units were rotated and transferred to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan.  This caused a shortfall in US troops posted in Europe and even made it impossible to carry out cooperation with their European allies as normal.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The report suggested terminating the plan to reduce US troops posted in Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Associated experts in the United States believe that the above phenomenon indicates that the prolonged delay in resolving the Iraq war has already upset the original adjustment plan of the US troops.</seg>

<seg id="5"> In the last few years, as personnel have been replaced, a portion of this battalion's apartments in this family dormitory building was over-occupied, contrary to regulations, which made it difficult for cadres in service to find accommodation.  Officers and men have expressed considerable objections concerning this matter.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The battalion also cleared out the apartments several times before, but due to resistance they settled the matter by leaving it unsettled, which turned this issue into a long-standing problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "If only one sticks to one's guns and is fair and reasonable, there are no unsolvable problems."</seg>
<seg id="8"> After the new party committee team achieved consensus, major leaders came out in person to set about completely clearing up all the problems where apartments were occupied contrary to regulations.</seg>
<seg id="9"> On the one hand, they appealed to people's emotion and explained through reason, hoping that the people concerned would consider the overall situation; on the other hand they explained clearly the related policies and regulations on military apartments, pooled housing and economic housing, and made clear the party committee's determination, resolve and standpoint on principles.</seg>
<seg id="10"> For some people with housing elsewhere yet unwilling to withdraw from over-occupied housing, the party committee promptly contacted their work unit and took corresponding steps to urge them to actively cooperate with the army's work.</seg>
<seg id="11"> After two months of painstaking work, all the residents of buildings on the campgrounds that were over-occupied against regulations moved out on schedule and the serving battalion cadres were allotted housing according to regulations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> This style in which the Battalion Party Committee dares to stick to its guns and struggle against obstacles also created a domino effect: a few cadres originally unwilling to actively cooperate with the organization's allocation, now also, one by one, expressed submission to the organization's decision.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Staff Report, Beijing, July 13 - Report by Yang Baojin and Correspondent Liu Xinxin: Starting on August 1, every army in the entire armed forces will successively change to wearing the 07 style uniform.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Jingjiang City People's Armed Forces Department Builds Platform to Improve Quality of Their Full-time Cadres</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Staff Report by Cao Jiawei and Zhu Chunbin: On June 18, in a class where Jiangsu province Jingjiang City People's Armed Forces full-time cadres assembled for training, a tutorial course on "Winning the Psychological War under Informationalized Conditions" taught by Lu Yuqing, director of the People's Armed Forces Department from Xilai town, received unanimous acclaim from participating students.</seg>
<seg id="3"> This is a new change achieved by the People's Armed Force Department of this city through giving their full-time cadre actual pressure appropriate to their positions in an effort to improve their overall quality .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> At the beginning of this year, during a grassroots survey, this People's Armed Forces Department Party Committee discovered that some full-time cadres have worked for a long number of years, held too many posts concurrently and were not putting their main effort into doing People's Armed Forces work.</seg>
<seg id="5"> For this reason, they adopted centralized training, held meetings instead of lectures, relied on local party schools to perform training and other methods, and periodically carried out training for full-time cadre in an effort to solve such problems as the full-time cadres' narrow sphere of knowledge, singular professional capability, etc.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Based on core work, they boldly assigned duties and increased the pressure on People's Armed Forces full-time cadres, and through on-the-job training improved their work competence.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Meanwhile, they actively coordinated with local organization departments and jointly drew up the "People's Armed Forces Full-time Cadre Achieving Position through Competition Plan."  This clarifies the regulation that the director of the People's Armed Forces Department must enter the party committee leading group at the same grade and may not concurrently hold any other offices.</seg>
<seg id="8"> A full-time cadre rotation arrangement system was established to promptly rotate and exchange older full-time cadre unable to adapt to grassroots People's Armed Forces work, while those comrades with good overall character and strong work capabilities were given promotions and put to use.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Not long ago, Chen Yisong, the secretary in charge of the People's Armed Forces Department at New Century Shipyard Ltd., led a militia technical squad that innovated and developed an underwater vessel welding technology which made up for a deficiency in this nation.  He was given an accelerated promotion to director of the company's People's Armed Forces Department.</seg>

<seg id="1"> If You Start Well, You Should Finish Well</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Simply speaking from the match result, a 2-2 score is reasonable and is also acceptable to the Chinese team.  The key is that the match itself left people feeling somewhat disappointed.</seg>
<seg id="3"> If Iran was in the lead 2-0 and then China came back to even the score, the impression given to Chinese fans would definitely be different and morale would have lifted a lot.  What a pity that the situation was exactly the opposite.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> One could say that starting well and being unable to finish well is an old problem for the Chinese team.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The Chinese team often plays poor soccer when their situation is extremely favorable, and the view of the average person is that the Chinese players are mentally not strong enough.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Indeed, this is one of the reasons China is incapable of "finishing well."</seg>
<seg id="7"> However, looking at China's match tonight, this does not necessarily seem to be the case.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Not mentioning Sun Jihai, Sun Xiang, Shao Jiayi, Zhen Zhi and others who played soccer in Europe before, Li Weifeng and others are also old war veterans.  They have extensive experience and, logically speaking, should not have any problems pschologically.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Regretfully, this Chinese team was held to a draw by Iran, and I am afraid that the reason was ineffective deployment of troops in the course of a battle.</seg>
<seg id="10"> While lagging behind, Iran substituted two people, and the scene immediately improved.</seg>
<seg id="11"> China also substituted three players in the second half, but the result was not good.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> To overcome the old problem of starting well and being unable to finish well, they must correctly determine the source of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="13"> As long as the problem can be correctly determined, it should not be hard to find a way to remove the problem.</seg>
<seg id="14"> What they really should fear is acting blindly out of desperation.</seg>
<seg id="15"> If they continue this way, no matter how many matches the Chinese team play, they will continue to repeat their old problem.  This is a far cry from everyone's expectation to see them improve with each match they play.</seg>

<seg id="3"> Report by Li Guoliang and Huang Qi: For many years, at the same time as ensuring medical treatment for the army is done well, the Hospital of Guangdong Frontier Defense Army has tried its hardest to rescue and assist people in difficulties, like a wave of compassion that softens the hearts of the general public everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="4"> This morning, a meeting celebrating the award of Second Class Collective Merit by the Public Security Ministry to the Hospital of Guangdong Frontier Defense Army and reporting the exemplary deeds of supporting the government and cherishing the people  was solemnly held in Shenzhen.</seg>

The registration fee for a doctor's visit for migrant workers is only one yuan, and examination fees and surgical fees are all at 20% off.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The hospital specially outfitted a "Compassion Service Vehicle" which at no costs picks up and returns rural migrant worker patients for hospital visits, and issued the rural migrant worker's "Health Service Card;" each person needs only pay seven yuan per month and can enjoy 12 basic medical examination and insurance items.</seg>
<seg id="7"> This measure to benefit people has already benefitted over 12,000 rural migrant workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Beginning in 2003, the hospital also launched the "Light a Thousand Lamps" large scale charitable medical examination campaign.  They successively organized ophthalmic doctors and nurses to go to far-off Tibet, Jiangxi, Yunnan, Qinghai and other regions eight times to "Give Light, Give Health," and carried out close to 3,000 cataract operations for free, allowing patients to see light once again.</seg>

<seg id="1"> "Small, Scattered, Remote and Direct" Education Coordination Sections at a Second Artillery Base Begin Operations</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Staff Report by Xue Bingjian and Correspondent Xu Yeqing: The phenomenon of difficult organization, few resources, and individual operation in educating the "small, scattered, remote and direct" units will become a thing of the past at a Second Artillery base.</seg>
<seg id="3"> In recent days, this reporter learned that after half a year of trials, this base issued "Methods of Implementing the 'Ideological and Political Education Syllabus'" to the grassroots levels.  A number of ideological and political education coordination sections covering all the "small, scattered, remote and direct" units at the base were officially set in operation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> To promote effective implementation of the "Ideological and Political Education Syllabus," at the beginning of the year, this base used their organizational abilities to conduct an in-depth investigation into the current situation of ideological and political education in "small, scattered, remote and direct" units at the base.  They combed through the key problems affecting and restricting education time, staff and effectiveness, and preliminarily formed this kind of new education format of coordination sections for "small, scattered, remote and direct" units.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The specific modus operandi of the coordination section is to break down unit organization boundaries, specify a brigade or regiment level unit to take the lead in a region with relatively concentrated "small, scattered, remote and direct" units in unified planning of topical education.  Units having different subordinate relationships either attend classes nearby together or hold remote discussions by way of a video system.</seg>
<seg id="6"> A combined method of giving classes in rotation and competing for posts is adopted to unify allocation of educational strength.  Educational hardware in parts of a region was used jointly; and the information, data and educational experiences of all units were shared and exchanged.  Typical reporting tours in parts of the region are periodically organized, and officers and soldiers exchange what they have learned.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Each coordination section has established a full-time education liaison and a part-time educational information collector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> On this basis, each coordination section has also set up systems to seek help on difficult problems, discuss important educational subject matters, report urgent ideological situations, and to test and appraise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Director of the political department at the base, Zhang Shengmin, told reporters that establishing political education coordination sections has not only reduced wastage of educational resources, but has also deepened the effect of the education.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Some politics instructors were afraid to lose points in front of officers and men from other units, so they took the initiative to learn new knowledge and seek out new methods of education.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The officers and men receiving education also actively digested the educational content lest they sounded unprofessional in front of officers and men from neighboring units in their discussions and analyses.</seg>
<seg id="12"> In so doing, the enthusiasm of the educators and the educated has been both effectively stirred up.</seg>

<seg id="2"> Staff Report by Zhang Junhong and Li Hongjun: On July 17, under the leadership of Zhang Weiliang, deputy chief engineer of a North China Sea fleet maintenance battalion, the battalion's 31 soldiers working long-term on the maintenance frontline cheerfully stepped onto the R&R train bound for Beidaihe.</seg>
<seg id="3"> NCO Class 6 Luo Xiangming happily told the writer: "Battalion leaders caring about and taking care of soldiers have moved us deeply.  After returning from R&R, we will definitely work twice as hard!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> This is the first time this battalion has organized R&R for grass- roots soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Not long ago, when battalion commander Yao Qingsheng went down to the grassroots units, he saw some soldiers in charge of maintenance work carrying out equipment repairs while braving the high temperatures; it left Yao Qingsheng profoundly moved.</seg>
<seg id="6"> "Soldiers forget about themselves when working; the party committee should care about and take care of soldiers and take responsibility for their health."  At the party committee meeting, Yao Qingsheng's words won everybody's approval.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Following research by the party committee, a decision was made to completely allocate the R&R quota assigned to the battalion by their superiors to soldiers working on the maintenance frontline.</seg>

<seg id="2"> Staff Report</seg>
<seg id="3"> Report by Wang Weiqin and Special Correspondent Li Deying: On July 25, at a Service Support Company of Jinan Military Command, the writer saw a public notice board written on with army engineering tenders, financial expenses, cadre promotions, NCOs joining the party, and other important issues prominently hung up in a display window.</seg>
<seg id="4"> As introduced by political commissar Su Chengsen, this is a concrete action taken by this department to push forward the open office work system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> At the beginning of this year, this army party committee formulated the "Office and Grassroots Bidirectional Supervision," "Public Notices of Sensitive Issue," and other measures to strengthen the building of party conduct and clean government.  These require that important issues involving the immediate interests of officers and soldiers and army construction are only decided after listening to the opinion of grassroots officers and soldiers.  Also, depending upon the situation, the entire process of office standards, procedures, results, etc. are made public.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The army set up a suggestion box and notice board, opened up a "message board" on their Intranet and extensively collected everybody's opinions and suggestions.</seg>
<seg id="7"> At the beginning of the year, the soldier's dormitory refurbishment project started.  Before work got underway, the party committee extensively solicited opinion from officers and soldiers, and then issued a public tender notice and carried out public tender bidding.</seg>
<seg id="8"> This both saved expenditures and won the support of officers and soldiers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Conducting work openly and fairly has spurred a good atmosphere to take shape at the grassroots level.</seg>
<seg id="10"> In this army, whether it is settling upon work as large as 'hot issue' sensitive affairs or as small as taking personal vacation time to visit one's relatives, the everyday expenditure on mess accounts and other items, the grassroots company persists with scheduled public notices and publications, and take the initiative to accept mass supervision.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, London, July 2 - Icelandic scientists discovered through research that people with mutation in two types of gene in the body have a far greater risk of getting afflicted with atrial fibrillation than the average person.</seg>
<seg id="3"> According to a report in the latest issue of Nature magazine, after screening the genes of several thousand people from Iceland, Sweden, the US, and the Hong Kong region of China, researchers at Iceland's deCODE Genetics Company made the above discovery.</seg>
<seg id="4"> These two types of gene discovered by scientists are located near that of a type of gene that plays an important role in the early stages of heart development.</seg>
<seg id="5"> AF, i.e. atrial fibrillation, is clinically one of the most commonly seen cardiac arrhythmias and can give rise to heart palpitations, shortness of breath, tiredness and sudden stroke.</seg>
<seg id="6"> In addition, according to a report in Nature Genetics magazine published on the 1st, researchers at deCODE Genetics Company also discovered two types of gene on human chromosome 17 correlating to prostate cancer morbidity.  They exert some kind of effect in more than one third of prostate cancer cases.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Maracaibo (Venezuela), July 3 (Correspondent Liu Jian)</seg>
<seg id="3"> According to a Venezuelan media report on the third, US team's 37-year-old veteran goalkeeper Keller said in an interview here that if he is unable to find a suitable club to serve after the America Cup, then he will choose retirement.</seg>
<seg id="4"> "If I am still unable to obtain a one to two season contract in a high level league team four to six weeks after the America Cup ends, then perhaps retirement is not a bad option for me."</seg>
<seg id="5"> With Munchen-Gladbach falling to the German Bundesliga 2, Keller also left this team which he served for more than two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Although Keller is considering turning in his gloves, he obviously has more than enough suitors who are interested in him.  He spoke candidly that at present, as many as eight teams are interested in inviting him to join them,</seg>
<seg id="7"> yet this veteran goalkeeping idol, who has served in the Spanish Primera League, the English Premier Division, and German Bundesliga 1, expressed that how he finally decides, depends upon his family, "My child is already 9 years old, he has stayed with me in three different countries and gone to three different schools.  My choice now must consider how to better benefit my family."</seg>
<seg id="8"> In the Gold Cup that ended not long ago, Keller performed outstandingly and helped the US team capture the championship.</seg>
<seg id="9"> In the current America Cup, he was still entrusted with the important task by head coach Bradley, but what can one man do against overwhelming odds; a US team of "Elite Young Guards" setting out to do battle is fundamentally no rival for such South American giants as Argentina and Paraguay.  In these two matches, the goal he guarded was penetrated 7 times.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The next match, paired up against Columbia, is very likely to be the US team's and Keller's final performance in the current America Cup.</seg>

<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 11 (Correspondents Liu Yang and Pi Shuchu)</seg>
<seg id="3"> Thirteen pilots submitted their resignation, and "the boss," China Eastern Airlines Wuhan Limited Liability Company, wrote out a compensation sheet for as high as the massive amount of 105 million.  Up until now, this is a labor dispute case which involves Hubei province's largest compensation amount.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The Hubei Province Labor Dispute Arbitration Committee is currently examining this case.</seg>
<seg id="5"> In May this year, 13 pilots at China Eastern Wuhan Company successively submitted their resignation and were refused by the company.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Subsequently, in the beginning of June, the pilots one by one submitted labor arbitration applications to the Hubei Province Labor Dispute Arbitration Committee, petitioning for an arbitration decision to terminate their working relationship with China Eastern Wuhan Company.</seg>
<seg id="7"> After China Eastern Wuhan Company received the notice to respond to the lawsuit, they submitted a countersuit demanding the 13 pilots to separately pay them varying consequential damages of over 6 million to over 10 million yuan, in a total of 105 million yuan, for dissolving the employment contract in breach of employment contract stipulations.</seg>
<seg id="8"> To our understanding, the pilots signed an open-ended employment contract with China Eastern and, unless termination conditions or dissolution conditions stipulated in the employment contract appear, the legal force of the employment contract will continue until the pilot's legal retirement age.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The Hubei Province Labor Dispute Arbitration Committee will examine and handle the suit and countersuit in this case together, and hopes to conclude proceedings before August 8.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Riga, July 12 (Correspondent Yang Dehong) The German Foreign Minister Steinmeier, visiting Latvia on the 12th, called on the Russians to pass the Latvia-Russia border treaty as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="3"> That day, Steinmeier and Latvian Foreign Minister Pabriks held a meeting together.  Both parties primarily discussed Latvian-German relations, Latvian and EU cooperation, and other issues.  They also exchanged opinions and perspectives on the development of Latvian-Russian relations and EU-Russian relations.</seg>
<seg id="4"> At the press conference held after the meeting, Steinmeier called on the Russians to pass the Latvia-Russia border treaty as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Steinmeier said that the pace of improvement in relations between Latvia, all the Baltic Sea States, and Russia is relatively slow.  Signing of the Latvia-Russia border treaty testifies to the course of development of Latvian-Russian relations, but the "shadow of history" also may possibly cause Latvian-Russian relations to regress again and he hopes the Russian side can pass the Latvia-Russia border treaty as early as possible in order to expedite forward development of relations between the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="6"> On March 27 this year, after as long as ten years of negotiations, Latvian Prime Minister Kalvitis and Russian Prime Minister Fradkov signed a bi-national border treaty in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="7"> On May 17, the Latvian parliament passed the Latvia-Russia border treaty.</seg>
<seg id="8"> According to Latvian media reports, the Russian parliament will vote on the treaty in the near future.</seg>

<seg id="6"> When speaking about the maritime boundary issue which is an existing dispute between both parties, Pak Rim Su said for both parties to prevent the occurrence of military conflict in the western sea region, both parties should give up the maritime boundary each has persisted with and mutually acknowledge and respect territorial sea rights, and should take the related agreements between North and South Korea, the North and South Korea Cease-fire Agreement and internationally-recognized law as a basis for negotiation.</seg>
<seg id="7"> He expressed that the prompt formulation of military safeguard measures to move ahead with North-South cooperative exchange is the "position always maintained" by the North Korean military.</seg>
<seg id="8"> He said that the South Korean side should currently take military measures to ensure North Korea's civilian shipping can go from Haeju Port directly to the south and freely transit the Cheju Strait.</seg>
<seg id="9"> This is the second working-level military contact talks held by the two parties, North and South Korea, since the tenth of this month.</seg>

He, therefore, requested to place additional orders.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, London, July 26 - British police announced on the 26th that a suspected offender has been arrested in Clitheroe, Lancaster County, on the 23rd for making bomb threats to the British "Tesco" supermarket in the middle of July.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Police said the person is named Philip McHugh, who is 51 years old and unemployed.  He will be charged with carrying out blackmail and making bomb scares.</seg>
<seg id="4"> On the afternoon of July 14 (Saturday), 14 "Tesco" supermarkets throughout Britain were urgently closed by police due to receiving bomb threats and did not return to business until the next day.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Saturday just happens to be the peak time for the British people to go shopping at the supermarket.  At that time, the closing of 14 supermarkets caused Britain's largest supermarket chain to lose several million British pounds of sales income.</seg>
<seg id="6"> British police subsequently carried out a criminal investigation on this bomb threat incident and announced that in this incident they did not discover any sign of terrorist activity, but certain economic motivations are likely to be behind this.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 28 (Correspondent Cui Junqiang) When next year's Olympics are held, Beijing in August, with its high temperature and humidity, is expected to transform into a sea of fresh flowers.</seg>
<seg id="3"> By employing technology to change the flower season, and other measures, scientific researchers have found a good strategy to add color to the Olympic Games.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> At the "Summer Olympics Optimal New Flower Variety Selection and Cultivation Applications Research" project acceptance meeting held on the 28th in Beijing, assessment experts arrived at the conclusion that the use of new technology to spur and control flower cultivation will enable different flower types or varieties with different natural flower seasons to bloom in the same time in the summer, thus the best visual effect will be achieved in August when the Beijing Olympic Games will be held .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In the Beijing summer, often only a dozen or so types of blooming flowers can be seen.  The majority of flowers have either already withered or are still a long time away from their buds opening.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Through their endeavors, scientific researchers chose 206 types and over 400 varieties of the most optimal flowers for the Summer Olympics.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> At the "2007 Olympics Flower Exhibition" to be held in Haidian Park, Beijing, around the one year countdown to the Beijing Olympic Games opening, a batch of fresh and bright-colored flowers carefully cultivated by scientific researchers, that in the past have been unable to naturally bloom in August, will welcome visitors.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The three-day high-level military talks between South and North Korea ended in discord today due to divergence over delimitation of sea border.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> "We've come to a conclusion that we don't need these fruitless talks any more," said North Korea's chief delegate Lieutenant-General Kim Yong-Chol as the talks at the border city of Panmunjom went into the last day's agenda today.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> A red-faced and apparently angry Kim Yong-Chol attacked South Korea for intentionally avoiding delimitation of a new maritime border to replace the existing Northern Limit Line.</seg>
<seg id="5"> He said the "Northern Limit Line" was not legal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The Northern Limit Line in the Yellow Sea was drawn up by the US forces in 1953 in the wake of the Korean War. However, it has become the focus of disputes between the two Koreas in recent years. Even worse, North Korea refuses to recognize it.</seg>
</p>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> US Treasury Secretary Paulson arrived in China yesterday for a visit, as the US was trying its best to convince China to further carry out necessary economic reforms and environmental protection efforts, especially the issue of RMB exchange rate that receives wide attention.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> US diplomats said Paulson was first headed to Xining, the capital of the vast northwestern province of Qinghai.</seg>
<seg id="4"> China is currently implementing a series of environmental protection initiatives near the largest salt-water lake in Qinghai Province.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="5"> Paulson left for Beijing today to discuss with Chinese officials in charge topics such as promotion of the US-China Strategic Economic Dialogue launched last year .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The US-China Strategic Economic Dialogue mainly covers economic, environmental and other issues, but the one at the forefront is the exchange rate of RMB, which is seen by lawmakers in the United States as significantly undervalued.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> There has been growing pressure within the US as the US trade deficit with China soars. US lawmakers plan to take retaliatory actions to fight against what they call unfair trade policies of China.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Last week the US Senate Finance Committee overwhelmingly approved a bill requiring the Treasury to identify nations with "fundamentally misaligned" currencies, potentially opening the door to economic sanctions against Beijing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> US lawmakers say the undervalued RMB makes US-bound goods from China extremely cheap, thereby exacerbating trade imbalance between the US and China, with the US trade deficit with China hitting 232.5 billion US dollars last year.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> July 31 chinanews.com - Chen Shui-bian on the 30th questioned the island's judicial personnel for intervention into the leadership elections of the Taiwan region.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Kao Chin-chih, "Director-General of the Department of Judicial Administration at the Judicial Yuan" of Taiwan said on the same day that the current behaviors of judges on the island were inconsistent with what Chen Shui-bian said, and he demanded that Chen Shui-bian explain his comments.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to a report in Taiwan's United Daily, Chen Shui-bian on the 30th questioned judges, prosecutors and investigators for intervening, influencing or even attempting to manipulate election campaigns of candidates from different parties out of political factors or election considerations and said he hoped the phenomenon did not exist in Taiwan, but it might be very difficult.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In response to Chen Shui-bian's questioning, President of Taiwan "Judicial Yuan" Weng Yueh-sheng kept a low key with no responses, while "Secretary-General" Fan Kuang-chun appointed Kao Chin-chih to speak on behalf of the "Judicial Yuan."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Kao Chin-chih said both the fundamental law of Taiwan and "Judges Code of Conduct" state explicitly that judges should stay beyond parties and must not participate in party activities or assist with election campaigns; all judges have carefully observed relevant restrictions and the "Judicial Yuan" believes all judges are behaving very well.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Kao Chin-chih noted by giving an example, when Judge Jang Shenq-shii of Kaohsiung "Branch High Court" attended a program at the Ketagalan Institute several years ago, he was immediately decided to be punished by the self-regulation panel comprised of judges due to the partisan tint of relevant courses.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Jang Shenq-shii once wanted to run in the primary for the Progressive Party but eventually decided to quit, again amid controversy over his participation while in office.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Kao Chin-chih believes if it is the trial of an individual case, there is recourse to the appeal process. One should not infer the judge has ulterior political motives solely based on the result of the ruling.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Don't Worship Legal "Theorists" Blindly</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> It is stipulated in Article 8 of the Draft Amendment to the Attorneys Law recently submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for review that those who apply for practicing as an attorney and have senior professional designations or equivalent professional levels from previous professional work such as legal research and teaching, can be permitted to practice as a lawyer upon approval of the justice department of the State Council.</seg>
<seg id="3"> (June 28, China Youth Daily)</seg>
<seg id="4"> There are "theorists" and "practitioners" in law, where the former primarily involve "abstract behaviors" such as legal teaching and research, while the latter are more of "concrete behaviors" such as litigations, legal counseling and legal services.</seg>
<seg id="5"> For a long time, there has been mutual contempt between legal "theorists" and "practitioners." "Theorists" think "practitioners" are merely mechanical "legal dogmatists" lacking necessary attainments in the science of law, while criticisms of "practitioners" about "theorists" are directed at the "inability of theories to guide practice."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Given such gap in the division of labor, what law can do is to remain neutral rather than strongly support either of the two.</seg>
<seg id="7"> However, the "chartered attorney system" in the Attorneys Law recognizes the opinion factually that legal "theorists" are superior to legal "practitioners."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In reality, for some experts and scholars who study and teach pure legal theories such as the legal history and international law, no matter how profound and sophisticated their theories are, they are incompatible with legal practice.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Thus, the "chartered attorney system" has undoubtedly created a "bad opening" to confusions in legal "practitioner" qualifications, which has extremely adverse influence.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Blind worship of "theorists" does not stop here. Phenomena where reports of expert opinions and expert argumentation seminars often affect and even override court verdicts are also direct reflections of such blind worship.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> By Feng Lei, Guangming Daily</seg>
<seg id="3"> The reporter learned from a press conference of the State Council Information Office that beginning July 1 this year, China would implement an ad hoc tax-free registration policy for Chinese-funded vessels engaged in international shipping to encourage Chinese-funded ships flying foreign flags to register back in China, acquire the PRC nationality and operate under the Five-Starred Red Flag.</seg>
<seg id="4"> To further promote sound development of our nation's maritime industry and expand the national fleet, in response to relevant problems arising from the significant number of our vessels engaged in international voyages that register overseas and operate under foreign flags, the Ministry of Communications recently issued an Announcement on Implementing Ad Hoc Tax-Free Registration Policy for Chinese-Funded Vessels Engaged in International Shipping, which specifies the conditions and application procedures of enjoying the ad hoc tax-free registration policy. Eligible vessels are exempt from customs duty and import VAT if they submit import declarations within two years beginning July 1 this year.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Applying vessels may choose Shanghai, Tianjin or Dalian as the port of registry to go through the vessel registration procedures.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Traveling away from home, the aim is to be relaxed, refreshed and comfortable and to enjoy natural scenery and the achievements of social civilization to the maximum extent.</seg>
<seg id="3"> However, when traveling domestically, many people have experienced such annoyance, which is being blocked in public places by peddlers and those doing agent businesses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> No matter in a bus or a train, they are always persistently harassed by peddlers and illegal agents whenever getting on or off the vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="5"> If they are not selling eggs, peanuts or pies, then they are selling newspapers or magazines. Others are a large number of illegal agents who recommend restaurants or accommodations, or even peddle fake invoices.</seg>
<seg id="6"> If you don't accept, they may follow you several hundred meters, quite an air of I would rather die if I don't succeed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> At some scenic spots, many tourists feel the same way.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Before you even enter the gate, there will be someone peddling things like tourist souvenirs and small crafts.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Once you enter, there will be even more such things. Even the best mood will be dispelled.</seg>
<seg id="10"> A media agency once reported that while many foreign tourists to Xi'an were amazed by the famous and historic sites in Xi'an, they felt perplexed by piles of vendors and peddlers selling goods everywhere.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Public places like bus stops and scenic spots are supposed to be places for traveling and relaxing, where courtesy, order, quietness and harmony should prevail, so as to give tourists a comfortable and easy environment.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Free entry and exit of peddlers not only disturb tourists' moods, but also virtually destruct the public order at these public places, thus creating visual pollution and environmental pollution. In addition, it also provides conditions and opportunities for lawbreakers to stir up troubles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> What's important is that these public places are the window showcasing local cultural and ideological progress. Seeing a spot reveals the whole picture. What is damaged is not only a question of image, but it will also affect local economic development.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Just imagine, you want to make your tourism industry big and strong, but use such messy tourist environment to greet guests from around the world. Who will want to come, and who will dare to come?</seg>
<seg id="15"> Then, how does your tourism economy yield any benefits?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> With the high season coming for tourism, it should be a priority to create a civilized tourism environment for tourists from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Public places are not markets. Business activities of vendors and peddlers should be regulated. Those who operate without a license should be firmly removed, and illegal activities should be firmly suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Only a civilized and orderly environment will make tourists come, go and return gladly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> In a nutshell, don't let peddlers disturb public places.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> By giving away things like refrigerators, the Jianguomen subdistrict of Beijing's Dongcheng district has awarded 12 households enjoying the minimum living allowance for opting out of the minimum living standard scheme.</seg>
<seg id="3"> (The Beijing News - July 10)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The author is happy for these households for the improvement in their living, but has mixed feelings towards the term "opting out of the minimum living standard scheme" and the practice of "awarding."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> "Regarding problems such as cheating on the minimum living allowance, encouraging people to opt out of the minimum living standard scheme is to set examples for other households enjoying the minimum living allowances," Deputy Director at the Jianguomen Subdistrict Office said.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Such examples are indeed worth promoting if they are to encourage other people enjoying the minimum living allowance to get out of difficulties through their own efforts; they are, however, a bit naive if the purpose is to "move" those who have cheated on the minimum living allowance for long.</seg>
<seg id="7"> In distinguishing between and cleaning up real and fake households entitled to the minimum living allowance, what should be relied on more is the law.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Competent authorities should highlight the obligations of households entitled to the minimum living allowance while they enjoy the minimum living standard allowance: for example, informing of changes in family members and income in a timely manner, reporting the employment situation, undergoing regular reviews etc. And competent authorities should intensify supervision and inspection.</seg>
<seg id="9"> After all, "withdrawal from the minimum living standard scheme pursuant to law" is the permanent solution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Who will pay for the in-kind rewards given by the subdistrict to the households who opt out of the minimum living standard scheme?</seg>
<seg id="11"> As a level of governmental organizations, the spending of a subdistrict is covered by fiscal allocation.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Yet should this money of the taxpayers be spent?</seg>
<seg id="13"> On the one hand, by opting out of the minimum living standard scheme, the households prove to have certain capacity to "sustain themselves;" on the other hand, aren't there still people claiming the minimum living standard allowance?</seg>
<seg id="14"> The government's fiscal allocation that is dubbed life-saving money should provide timely assistance rather than add icing to a cake.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> On July 10, Liu Gangyi, party committee secretary of Mulan Township in Xindu District, Chengdu, who is the country's first publicly nominated and directly elected township party committee secretary, had his fourth democratic assessment after taking office and achieved a satisfaction rate of 97%.</seg>
<seg id="3"> In the reporter's conversation with Liu Gangyi, Liu Gangyi positioned himself as a "servant."</seg>
<seg id="4"> (The Beijing News - a day ago)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The "servant" uttered by Liu Gangyi may be more real and convincing than the "servant" uttered by those appointed officials.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The biggest advantage of public nomination and direct election, compared with the mechanism of appointment, is that with the former, the source of authority is primarily decided by average party members and commoners, while the latter are appointed by a higher organizational level. And the direction of the source of authority determines the former must place their responsibility for the public at the top.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The source of authority and who to report to are the fundamental factors that decide how the elected go about their work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Some people question such "democratic assessment," saying it is more like a "show of democracy."</seg>
<seg id="9"> My view is that it is better to have this form of "democratic assessment" than nothing.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Considering the history and current situation of the grassroot democracy progress in China, I believe public nomination and direct election are already a major breakthrough. As an important part of this innovation, democratic assessment should not be underestimated in advancing the grassroot democracy progress.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Patil is the nominee of the ruling National Congress party, while Shekhawat is from the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Since the National Congress party dominates the electoral college for the president, both the media and the general public guess Patil has a higher possibility of being elected.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> On July 1, the Warning Bell at Jinghai Temple Memorial in Nanjing was struck again, giving melodious bell strokes.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The sophisticated echo of history "connected" the mainland and Hong Kong through a TV channel, so that Nanjing citizens and Hong Kong compatriots "shared the moments across the land" to celebrate together the 10th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to the motherland.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> At 12:00am July 1 ten years ago, the bell tower at Jinghai Temple Memorial in Nanjing was reverberated with 155 strokes of the Warning Bell, which bid farewell to the humiliating history of ceding the Hong Kong Island.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> People from various social circles of Nanjing gathered outside the modest-sized memorial entrance. They said they would strike the Warning Bell with their own hands, to warn themselves and offspring not to forget the history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> "The Warning Bell is 1.842 meters tall, and 1842 is just the year in which the Nanjing Treaty was signed during the Opium War.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The bell shoulder is 1.997 meters tall, and 1997 is the year in which Hong Kong returned."</seg>
<seg id="8"> Wang Fengling, past planner and creator of the Warning Bell explained, "five strings of 'swastikas' surround the bell body. The entire copper bell is in high relief, with two dragons holding up a fire ball, which symbolizes Hong Kong as the "oriental pearl" of the motherland. Last, Nanjing's city flower, the plum flower, is used as the striking pattern on the bell body."</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Borovkov, lawyer of the Russian oligarch Berezovsky exiled in London, said on July 2 that the Russian FSB has formally filed a new charge against his client, accusing Berezovsky of "conspiring to plot a coup against the state and attempting to seize Russian political power by violence."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> In an interview with a reporter of Britain's The Guardian in April this year, Berezovsky declared he was preparing to mount a "palace coup" in Russia, confirming he was providing financial assistance to representatives of the right-wing elites who were against the government policy, Borovkov noted.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The Russian FSB's Investigation Bureau immediately began criminal investigation in Berezovsky in compliance with article 278, Violent Seizure of Power, of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation and formally filed applicable charges to the Savelovsky Court in Moscow in recent days.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> It is learned that in February 2006, the Office of the Russian Persecutor General had filed criminal charges against Berezovsky, on the same ground that the exiled oligarch confirmed his attempt to obtain Russian political power by force.</seg>
<seg id="6"> As Berezovsky had been in exile abroad and could not be extradited, Russia halted probing of the case temporarily in January 2007.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The Savelovsky Court initiated another criminal case against the exiled oligarch, in which the Office of the Russian Persecutor General accused Berezovsky of embezzling funds of 214 million rubles from a Russian airway and laundering 16 million rubles. After hearings, the court has decided to postpone court probing until July 12 and will appoint a state defense attorney for the defendant during this time.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Berezovsky thought all these were "a farce" and clearly forbade his defense attorneys to participate in court trials.</seg>

<seg id="3"> As of now, 619 people have been held accountable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The reporter learned on the 5th from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Commission for Discipline Inspection that Guangxi has now initially developed a network for administrative efficiency supervision work at the three levels of the autonomous region, cities and counties, to intensify supervision of key departments and crucial posts. The electronic supervision systems of 14 cities have all been connected to that of the autonomous region.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The autonomous region's electronic supervision system of administrative efficiency has been connected directly to 33 key approval authorities directly affiliated to the autonomous region and 135 crucial posts that are relevant to the investment environment and people's production and lives, so as to further regulate approval practices and boost approval efficiency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In the meanwhile, discipline inspection and supervision authorities at all levels in Guangxi seriously probe into and handle cases that are related to working styles and efficiency and that harm people's interests. As of now, they have probed into and verified 1,104 cases, in which 769 have been concluded, and have held 584 organizations and 619 people accountable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Ma Tieshan, Standing Member of the Party Committee and Secretary of the Discipline Inspection Committee of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, said on the 5th that administrative efficiency supervision is a task throughout administrative activities, for which a mechanism of long-term effectiveness should be gradually developed.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Guangxi should further improve and regulate a variety of regulations and policies for administrative management, and establish and improve the operation mechanism and assurance mechanism of administrative efficiency supervision, bringing efficiency supervision onto an institutionalized and standardized track; further regulate supervision and inspection procedures, improve and complete mechanisms of complaint handling and performance evaluation and assessment; and intensify the degree of accountability, using strict accountability to guarantee the implementation of workplace policies including first respondent responsibility and completion of formalities within limited timeframe.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Two Jordanian men were sentenced to prison by Jordan's National Security Court on the 11th for plotting to attack Americans living in Jordan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> One of the two 25-year old men, Sameeh al-Hotari, was sentenced to eight years in prison with forced labor, and the other, Mohammed Shehada, was sentenced to three years in prison with forced labor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> A court source said al-Hotari was also charged with illegally possessing a gun, since police found a rifle when searching his home.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The court initially decided to sentence al-Hotari to life imprisonment, but then reduced the sentence to eight years in consideration of giving him an opportunity to "mend his ways."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The indictment said the two defendants decided to avenge Muslims "who were bullied by the Americans" after the Iraqi war erupted and so plotted to attack Americans living in Jordan.</seg>
<seg id="7"> In August 2006, they targeted an American who lived in a suburb of the Jordanian capital, Amman, but were arrested by police before they could attack him.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The indictment did not identify the American.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Reports of Diabetes Drug Avandia Causing Adverse Reactions Increase Significantly</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> According to a US media report on the 15th, there has recently been a tendency of significant increase in the number of adverse reaction reports, such as cardiac diseases, caused by the anti-diabetes drug Avandia in the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The US Food and Drug Administration issued a safety warning in May this year, advising diabetes patients to take Avandia with caution, because scientists issued a study report in an edition of the New England Journal of Medicine published on May 21, saying the best-selling drug would significantly increase the rates of heart attack and death in patients.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The safety of Avandia has thus been closely watched by doctors and patients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> According to statistics, within roughly a month after the safety warning, the US FDA received 357 reports of adverse reactions caused by Avandia, 38 of which are death reports.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Yet the FDA only received 50 and 73 reports of adverse reactions respectively in January and February this year.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The adverse reactions were as minor as blisters and as serious as sudden death due to heart attack.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> However, drug experts at the US FDA believe it is yet too early to conclude that Avandia is unsafe.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The FDA is going to hold a hearing regarding the safety of Avandia on July 30.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Avandia, introduced in 1999, is an insulin sensitizer for treating type II diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Some six million diabetes patients around the world has taken or is taking Avandia.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The manufacturer of Avandia, the UK company GlaxoSmithKline, has believed Avandia is safe and is "more beneficial than harmful" to patients.</seg>

<seg id="1"> US Pentagon Rethinks Plan to Cut US Troops in Europe</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A US Defense Department official said on the 23rd that the US Pentagon is reconsidering a 2002 plan to cut US troops stationed in Europe by about half because of the war in Iraq and changes in the world situation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> With the ongoing Iraq War and worsened US relations with Russia and Iran, the Pentagon leadership has questioned the feasibility of the plan to slash troops stationed in Europe, the US media said, quoting a Defense Department official.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In 2002, the then Defense Secretary Rumsfeld announced the US would reduce troops in Europe from 113,000 to 71,000 by 2012, in order to create a "lean and effective" new force.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Total US troops stationed in Europe have decreased to 100,000 so far.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> However, Craddock, Commander of the US European Command, submitted a report to current Defense Secretary Gates in June this year, in which he questioned the aforesaid reduction plan.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The report says the slash of US troops stationed in Europe is accompanied by rotational transfer of many forces to Iraq and Afghanistan for battles, which leads to a shortage of US military personnel stationed in Europe, such that they are unable to conduct regular cooperation with European allies.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The report recommends halting the plan to cut US troops in Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Experts in the US believe the phenomenon above indicates that the Iraq War has been such a long drag that it has disrupted the original adjustment plan of the US military.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Three Major Functions of Modern Military Uniforms</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> First is the identifying function,</seg>
<seg id="3"> an important symbol to distinguish among armies of different nations, among different armed services, and between troops and civilians.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Although the purposes of military uniforms are basically the same in the armed forces of some 100 nations big or small around the world, no armed forces of any two nations have identical military uniforms.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Second is the symbolizing function.</seg>
<seg id="6"> To some extent, military uniforms not only reflect a country's vitality and national characteristics, but also centrally showcases the combating capabilities and servicemen qualities of a country's armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Of the three major categories of military uniforms, dress uniforms, service uniforms and combat & training uniforms, nothing is more able to fully demonstrate the might of a country and its military than the neat and elegant dress uniforms.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Third is the protective function.</seg>
<seg id="9"> With the rapid development of new and high-tech weapons, it has become a paramount issue in the development of military uniforms to improve the comprehensive protective performance of new combat & training uniforms, so that military uniforms have various functions, such as protecting from bullets, reconnaissance, chemistry, bacteria and radiation, as well as conditioning the temperature, humidity and air.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> CHENGDU, July 3, by the newspaper</seg>
<seg id="3"> By Qu Yimao and Yang Ruiyu: "The fact that we can live in an apartment is attributed to the determination and resolution of the battalion's Party committee office to vacate houses."</seg>
<seg id="4"> Today, more than ten cadres of a communications training battalion at the Chengdu Military Region who moved into apartments were all lit up with pleasure, as they were filled with admiration and gratitude for the working style of the "team" at the battalion's Party committee that dare to get serious and meet challenges when tackling thorny problems.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> A few years earlier, with staff changing and being replaced, some homes in the battalion's family dormitory building were over-occupied in violation of rules, which brought housing difficulties to cadres on active service. Both officers and soldiers are quite unhappy over it.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The battalion had tried to vacate the homes several times, but left it unsettled because of various resistance, making this problem a hard nut to crack.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "So long as we dare to get serious and are reasonable, there are no difficult problems that we can't solve."</seg>
<seg id="8"> Once the new Party committee reached the consensus, principal leaders went out personally to begin a thorough cleanup regarding the problem of irregular housing occupation.</seg>
<seg id="9"> They touched people sentimentally and enlightened them sensibly on the one hand, hoping that those involved could put the overall situation into perspective; on the other hand, they clarified applicable policies and rules of the troops about apartments, pool funded housing and economically affordable housing, expressing the resolute determination and fundamental stance of the Party committee.</seg>
<seg id="10"> For those people who had housing elsewhere, but were reluctant to return the over-occupied housing, the Party committee office made timely contact with their units and took necessary measures to urge them give cooperation to the troops' work on voluntary basis.</seg>
<seg id="11"> After two months of attentive efforts, all tenants in the barrack complex who over-occupied housing in violation of rules moved out on schedule, and the battalion's cadres on active service were all allocated housing in compliance with policies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The working style of the battalion's Party committee that dare to get serious and meet challenges also had chain effects, in that several cadres who were previously reluctant to give active cooperation in the organization's allocation have now said they would follow the organization's decisions.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> By Cao Jiawei and Zhu Chunbin, PLA Daily: On June 18, at an intensive training program for armed force cadres in the city of Jingjiang, Jiangsu Province, the lecture Win the Psychological Warfare in the Context of Informationization by Lu Yuqing, Director of the Xilai Town Department of People's Armed Force, received positive comments amongst all participants.</seg>
<seg id="3"> This was a fresh change as a result of the city's Department of People's Armed Force loading burdens onto armed force cadres and working to boost the overall quality of armed force cadres in line with the reality of different posts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> At the beginning of this year, when doing grassroot research, the Party committee of the Department of People's Armed Force found that some armed force cadres did not focus on doing work related to the armed forces due to long years of service and multiple duties.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Therefore, they have conducted training regularly for armed force cadres using such methods such as intensive training, meeting as a way of training, relying on local Party school to provide training, with a view to address problems such as narrow knowledge spectrum and lack of versatile work skills.</seg>
<seg id="6"> In line with the core responsibilities, it has assigned tasks and loaded burdens onto armed force cadres boldly to improve their competency through on-the-job practice.</seg>
<seg id="7"> In addition, by actively coordinating with local organization departments, they jointly formulated the Scheme of Position Competitions Amongst Armed Force Cadres, which explicitly requires head of an armed force department to be on the Party committee of the same level without concurrently assuming other jobs;</seg>
<seg id="8"> and set up an adjustment and exchange mechanism for armed force cadres, whereby some armed force cadres who are older or not suitable for grassroot armed force positions are adjusted or exchanged in a timely fashion, while comrades with good overall quality and high competency are promoted.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Recently, Chen Yisong, a clerk of the armed force department at the New Century Shipbuilding Co., Ltd., who led a militia technical unit to fill a void of the nation with their innovatively developed underwater ship welding technique, was promoted to the company's head of armed force department as an exception to the rule.</seg>

<seg id="1"> A Good Start Calls for a Good Ending</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Solely from the result of the game, a score of 2-2 is reasonable and also acceptable to the Chinese team. What's essential is the process of the game, which is somewhat disappointing.</seg>
<seg id="3"> If it was the Iranian team who led 2-0 before the Chinese team equalized the score, this would definitely give Chinese soccer fans different feelings and significantly boost morale. Unfortunately, things were just the opposite.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> A good start without a good ending could be said a chronic problem of the Chinese team.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The Chinese team often does not know how to play soccer under favorable circumstances. The conventional view is that Chinese players have less than satisfactory psychological quality.</seg>
<seg id="6"> This is indeed a reason why the Chinese team could not have a "good ending."</seg>
<seg id="7"> However, seen from today's game of the Chinese team, it seems this is not completely true.</seg>
<seg id="8"> People like Li Weifeng are experienced veteran players, let alone people like Sun Jihai, Sun Xiang, Shao Jiayi and Zheng Zhi who have played soccer in Europe. They have broad experience and knowledge, and should not have problematic psychological quality logically speaking.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The Chinese team was unfortunately forced into a draw by the Iranian team this time, most probably because of improper deployment of players.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The Iranian team substituted with two people while trailing behind and the situation improved instantly.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The Chinese team also substituted with three players, but the result was not good.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> To overcome the problem of having a good start without a good ending, the source of the problem must be spotted.</seg>
<seg id="13"> As long as the problem is spotted, it may not be difficult to find a solution to redress the problem.</seg>
<seg id="14"> What we fear is to see a doctor indiscriminately in case of an emergency disease.</seg>
<seg id="15"> If things go on like that, the chronic problem will persist no matter how many games the Chinese team plays, not to mention a step forward in each game that people expect.</seg>

<seg id="1"> "SDRD" education collaboration areas Launched in SAF Base</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> By Xue Bingjian and Reporter Xu Yeqing, PLA Daily: The phenomenon where education at small, dispersed, remote and direct (SDRD) units is hard to organize, lacking in resources and individually carried out will be history in a base of the Second Artillery Force.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The reporters learned recently that after a six-month pilot project, the base handed down Steps to Implement "Ideological and Political Education Outline" and several ideological and political education collaboration areas that cover all its SDRD units have officially begun operation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> To promote effective implementation of the Ideological and Political Education Outline, the base organized efforts to perform in-depth investigation and research into the status of ideological and political education at SDRD units early this year and sorted out key problems that affected and constrained the time, people and effects of the education, creating the new education pattern of collaboration areas for SDRD units.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The specific practice of the collaboration areas is to break the bound of units and in an area where the SDRD units are relatively concentrated, designate a brigade or regiment level unit as the coordinator, which will conduct centralized planning of theme education. Units of different relationships of subordination and affiliation attend lectures together at a close location or hold remote discussions with video systems.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Education capabilities are centrally allocated by way of rotational lectures in conjunction with position competitions; education hardware within a area is used in a coordinated manner, information and data, as well as experience in education of each unit are shared and exchanged, report tours about typical examples in an area are organized regularly, and officers and soldiers discuss what they have learned from study.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Each collaboration area has put in place a full-time education contact and a part-time education information collector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Building on this, the collaboration areas also established systems of seeking help with hard problems, joint consultations on major educational topics, emergency briefing of ideological situations, and that of assessment and evaluation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Zhang Shengmin, director of the base's Political Department, told the reporters that establishing the political education collaboration areas has not only minimized waste of educational resources, but also deepened the effects of education.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Some political instructors voluntarily learn new knowledge and seek new methods of education for fear of losing marks in front of officers and soldiers from other units.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Officers and soldiers receiving education also digest what is taught, for fear of saying anything unprofessional in front of officers and soldiers from friendly and neighboring units during discussion and analysis.</seg>
<seg id="12"> As such, passions of the educators and the educated are both effectively inspired.</seg>

<seg id="3"> By Wang Weiqin and special correspondent Li Deying: The authors saw on July 25 at the Service Company of a force at the Jinan Military Region that a bulletin board with such important issues as the force's invitations to tender for projects, financial spending, cadre promotions, and non commissioned officers joining the Party, was hung conspicuously in the display window.</seg>
<seg id="4"> According to the Commissar Su Chengsen, this was a concrete step of the force to promote the policy of transparent business procedures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Early this year, with a view to enhance the construction of an ethical Party culture and an integral governing body, the Party committee of the force developed measures such as Reciprocal Supervision between Authorities and Grassroots and Public Notification of Sensitive Issues and requested that opinions of grassroot officers and soldiers be heard before decisions are made on every major issue related to the vital interests of officers and soldiers and the construction of the military force and that business handling criteria, procedures and results be made transparent as necessary throughout the process.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The military force set up an opinion box, a bulletin board, and a "message board" on the Local Area Network to collect people's comments and suggestions extensively.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Early the year, renovation work of the soldiers' dormitory building got started. Before work began, the Party committee office solicited opinions of officers and soldiers extensively and then issued tender information to invite tenders openly,</seg>
<seg id="8"> not only saving funds, but also winning the support of officers and soldiers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Transparent and fair business procedures have brought about a healthy culture at grassroots.</seg>
<seg id="10"> In this military force, grassroot companies have consistently issued notifications and announcements on a regular basis and voluntarily accepted people's monitoring on such major issues as the decision of a hot and sensitive matter to such petty issues as family visits and vacations of individuals or daily expenses of food accounts.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> MARACAIBO (Venezuela), July 3, Xinhua (Reporter Liu Jian)</seg>
<seg id="3"> According to reports of the Venezuelan media on the 3rd, 37-year old US veteran goalkeeper Keller said in an interview here that he would choose to retire if he couldn't find an appropriate club to play for after Copa America.</seg>
<seg id="4"> "If in four to six weeks after Copa America I'm still unable to secure a contract for one or two seasons in a high-level league club, then retirement may not be a bad choice for me.</seg>
<seg id="5"> "With Monchengladbach relegated to Germany's second division, Keller left the team for which he played for more than two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Although Keller has the intention to stop, he, "still waiting for a boss at home," apparently doesn't have to worry about his next employment. He admitted that up to eight teams had made offers for him to join so far.</seg>
<seg id="7"> However, the veteran goalkeeper who has played in the Primera divisiÃ³n de Liga, English Premier League and Bundesliga, said how he would choose finally would depend on his family, "my child is already nine years old and he has been in three different countries and three different schools with me. My choice now will consider what is better for my family."</seg>
<seg id="8"> In the Gold Cup that ended not long ago, Keller helped the US team win the title with outstanding performance.</seg>
<seg id="9"> During this year's Copa America, while he was again entrusted with an important task by Head Coach Bradley, nevertheless he could hardly resist so many players with a single fist. The US team, embarking on the expedition as the "young guards," was not at all rivals of such strong South American teams as Argentina and Paraguay. In two matches, the goal he kept was broken seven times.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The next match against the Colombian team may well be the last performance of the US team and Keller in this year's Copa America.</seg>

<seg id="2"> BEIJING, July 28, Xinhua (Reporter Cui Junqiang) By the time the Olympics are held next year, the hot and humid Beijing in August is expected to become a sea of flowers.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Through such techniques as changing the florescence, researchers have found a good way to add colors to the Olympics.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> At the project review meeting for the "Selection and Applied Cultivation Studies of New Summer Olympic Flowers" in Beijing on the 28th, review experts concluded that using the new technology of forcing culture, flower breeds or varieties with different natural florescence can bloom concurrently in summer and reach the best state for viewing in August when Beijing Olympics are held.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In Beijing's summer, only a dozen flowers are commonly seen in full blossom. Most flowers are either withered early on or far from being in bud.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Through efforts, researchers selected over 400 varieties of flowers in 206 breeds for the summer Olympics.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> At the "2007 Olympic Flowers Exhibition" at Haidian Park in Beijing, a group of flowers carefully bred by researchers that could not bloom naturally in August in the past will greet visitors with bright-colored blossoms around the one-year countdown to the opening of the Beijing Olympics.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Chinanews.com, July 10 (Huang Dang)</seg>
<seg id="3"> The Price Administration of Lanzhou municipal government invited relevant departments to hold a forum for the price cap on beef noodles this afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The reporter learned from the meeting that the Price Administration and other departments of the city jointly promulgated a price cap mainly because the rate of increase of beef noodles was too high and had gone beyond the ability to afford of ordinary residents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Allegedly, the rate of increase of beef noodles had reached 20 percent this time. Statistics showed that this was the largest rate of increase within the shortest time since the early 1980's when the price of beef noodles in Lanzhou was raised for the first time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> "The government's action was a consideration of the economic ability of ordinary residents in the area. We promulgated the price cap after conducting a cost survey," the director of the Price Administration of Lanzhou municipal government said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> On the 26th of last month, four departments of Lanzhou including the Price Administration, the Administrative Bureau of Industry and Commerce, and the Bureau of Public Health jointly implemented a price cap on the beef noodles in the city. The news drew strong concern once it was announced.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> According to investigation, the objective of the forum was to widely solicit opinions from all circles to invite opinions and suggestions for the promulgation of specific regulatory measure in the next step. In addition, based on information released, Lanzhou will hold a press conference tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id="9"> It will be the second press conference for the price increase in beef noodles held by Lanzhou City.</seg>

<seg id="2"> The special hearing held by the World Motor Sport Council for the Ferrari technology espionage case ended in Paris last night Beijing time. McLaren, the racing team being summoned, escaped misfortune: The council decided not to penalize McLaren racecar team for the time being.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The official website of the World Motor Sport Council published a declaration after the hearing that said, "Vodafone McLaren Mercedes was in possession of confidential Ferrari information. However, there is insufficient evidence that this information was used in such a way as to interfere improperly with the FIA Formula One World Championship. We therefore impose no penalty."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Nonetheless, the Ferrari technology espionage case did not end here.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The World Motor Sport Council also stated in the decision, ""But if it is found in the future that the Ferrari information has been used to the detriment of the championship, we reserve the right to invite Vodafone McLaren Mercedes back in front of the WMSC where it will face the possibility of exclusion from not only the 2007 championship but also the 2008 championship."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Mike Coughlan, former chief designer of McLaren who has now been terminated, was found to possess nearly 800 pages of Ferrari technical dossier containing a whole set of interconnections including the design, power, building, inspection, testing, development, and running of the 2007 Ferrari race cars.</seg>

<seg id="3"> According to report of China Securities, the Interim Administrative Measures for the Management of Offshore Investments of Insurance Funds was promulgated a few days ago. Insurance funds thus have wider room for utilization in the capital market.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Liu Lefei, Chief Investment Officer at China Life Insurance, believed that with the appreciation of the Renminbi and the strong domestic capital market, insurance institutions will not engage in large-scale offshore investments through foreign exchange purchase. This also implies that the Insurance QDII will not divert funds in domestic stock market in the near future.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The report stated that many insurance institutions shared the same view.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Expert stated that since a Renminbi derivative market still does not exist at the present moment, insurance institutions do not have adequate measures to avert risk. Therefore, conditions are not yet ripe for large-scale foreign exchange purchase.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Liu Lefei said that in the long run, in the area of asset allocation, offshore investments should make up a considerable portion in the overall allocation of insurance companies.</seg>
<seg id="8"> However, since the Renminbi has rather huge appreciation pressure at present, China Life Insurance will mainly utilize exchange funds that it has in offshore investments.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Caution should be given to the purchase of foreign exchange for offshore investments under current situation.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Chinanews.com, July 31 - Chen Shui-bian on the 30th raised doubts about attempts of judicial members in the island to intervene in the election of Taiwan regional leaders.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Kao Chin-chih, "Director-General of the Department of Judicial Administration" in Taiwan, stated on the same day that judges in the island are behaving differently from what Chen Shui-bian described and demanded an explanation from Chen Shui-bian for his remark.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to report of the United Daily News of Taiwan, Chen Shui-bian raised doubts about judges, prosecutors, and investigators intervened, influenced, and even attempted to control the election campaigns of various party candidates out of political factors or consideration for the elections. He claimed that he hoped this situation does not exist in Taiwan but it may be extremely difficult.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In response to the doubt of Chen Shui-bian, Weng Yueh-sheng, "President of the Judicial Yuan" in Taiwan maintained a low-key and did not respond while "Secretary-General" Fan Kuang-chun appointed Kao Chin-chih to speak for the Judicial Yuan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Kao Chin-chih stated that the Fundamental Law of Taiwan and the "judges' rules and regulations" both proclaim in explicit terms that judges should transcend political parties and groups. They cannot participate in activities of political parties or assist in the campaign. Judges all follow relevant restraints cautiously. The Judicial Yuan believed that all judges have done well.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Kao Chin-chih quoted an example by saying that Chang Sheng-hsi, judge of the "Kaohsiung Branch of the Supreme Court", took part in the course offered by the Ketagalan Institute a few years ago. Since the related course had party flavor, the self-disciplinary committee formed by judges decided to take disciplinary action against him.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Chang Sheng-hsi once wanted to run in the primary election of the Democratic Progressive Party but due to the controversy over running in the election while in office, he finally decided to give up.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Kao Chin-chih argued that if it is for the trial of individual case, one can lodge an appeal to the court of higher instance. One cannot infer that judges have other political intentions solely based on the outcome of the verdict.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> This newspaper, Berlin, July 1, (Reporter Wang Huaicheng)</seg>
<seg id="3"> Schavan, German Minister of Education and Research, said a few days ago that Germany should lower the restrictions on the importation of foreign professionals in the Immigration Law to resolve the shortage of professionals in Germany through an increase in the importation of foreign talents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to the report of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the size of labor force between the age of 15 and 64 in Germany will drop every year till 2010.</seg>
<seg id="5"> If there are insufficient immigrants, Germany's labor force in 2020 will be 6 percent smaller than it is now.</seg>
<seg id="6"> However, reports of organizations including the Confederation of German Employers' Associations and the Association of German Engineers showed that in current German labor market, the shortages in engineers and skilled technicalprofessionals are bigger.</seg>
<seg id="7"> According to data from the German Federal Labor Office, as of this May, there was a shortage of approximately 12,700 people in the supply of engineers and a shortage of 9,600 people in the supply of technicians in the German labor market.</seg>
<seg id="8"> In order to protect the employment of its nationals, Germany has set a rather high threshold for the importation of foreign talents.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The German Immigration Law stipulates that the annual salaries of professionals from non-EU countries must not be lower than 85,500 euros, otherwise they will not be able to obtain a work and residence permit in Germany.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Don't Have Blind Faith in Legal "Theoretical Circle"</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Article 8 of the draft amendment of the Law on Lawyers recently submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for deliberation stipulates: people who have professional experiences in the research or teaching of law, with advanced professional titles or corresponding professional competence, may obtain a lawyer's license, and get approval from judicial departments under the State Council.</seg>
<seg id="3"> (June 28, China Youth Daily)</seg>
<seg id="4"> There is a difference between the "theoretical circle" and the "practical circle" in law. The former mainly includes "abstract behaviors" such as the teaching and research of law while the latter are more "concrete behaviors" such as engaging in litigations, legal consultations, and legal services.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The phenomenon of "scorning of each other" has long existed between the theoretical circle and the practical circle in law. The theoretical circle argues that the practical circle lacks necessary legal attainments and is simply mechanical "legalist" while the direction of criticism of the practical circle on the theoretical circle is that "theories cannot guide practice".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In regards to such a divergence of division of labor, what law can do is to remain neutral instead of supporting any one side with mightiness.</seg>
<seg id="7"> However, the "chartered lawyer system" in the Law on Lawyers has objectively endorsed the judgment that the theoretical circle is superior to the practical circle in law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In fact, for some experts and scholars who engage in pure research and teaching of legal theories such as the history of legal system and international laws, no matter how thoroughly accomplished they are in theories, they will still be out of step with practical legal issues.</seg>
<seg id="9"> In this case, chartered lawyer system has no doubt set a "bad precedent" with extremely harmful effects on the qualification confusion in the practical circle in law.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The blind faith in the theoretical circle is not only limited to these. For instance, expert submissions and expert appraisal meetings always influence and even veto court verdicts. This phenomenon is also a direct manifestation of such blind faith.</seg>

<seg id="3"> However, when traveling in China, many people encounter such an annoyance of being encircled, pursued, obstructed, and intercepted by peddlers and people engage in intermediary businesses in public places.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> When people getting on or off the vehicle, no matter car or train, they are always pestered by peddlers and some unlicensed middlemen.</seg>
<seg id="5"> If they are not selling eggs, peanuts, and sesame seed cakes, then they are selling newspapers and magazines, and then the many unlicensed middlemen recommending restaurants and hotels, and even selling fake documents and fake invoices so on and so forth.</seg>

<seg id="7"> Many visitors also feel the same in some scenic spots.</seg>
<seg id="8"> People come to peddle things such as travel souvenirs and small handicrafts and things like that before one enters the door.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The situation increases once one enters the door. No matter how bright one's mood is, it will still be spoiled and one will feel insipid.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The media once reported that many foreign visitors to Xi'an spoke very highly of the scenic spots and historical sites of Xi'an. However, they could not understand why heaps of peddlers were allowed to peddle everywhere.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Public places such as stations and scenic spots are originally places where journey embarks or for leisure. Good manners and order, as well as peace and harmony should be stressed to provide visitors with a comfortable and relaxing environment.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Not only does the come and go at will of the peddlers disturb visitors' mood, objectively, they have disrupted the public order of these public places and caused visual and environmental pollution, and at the same time, it also provides conditions and opportunities to lawbreakers to incite trouble.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The important thing is that these public places are the windows of local spiritual civilization. Seen one and you have seen them all. What is being damaged is not only the issue of image, it also affects the economic development of the area.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Imagine, you want to make tourist industry a success but greet guests from all over with this dreadfully disordered tourist environment. Who still wants to come? Who still dares to come?</seg>
<seg id="15"> How can your tourist economy produce returns?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> With the arrival of peak travel season, top priority should be given to the creation of a civilized travel environment for visitors from all over.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Public places are not markets. The operating behaviors of peddlers should be regulated. Unlicensed operation should be adamantly abolished and illegal activities should be firmly suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Only a civilized and orderly environment will enable visitors to come gladly, to return after fully enjoying themselves, and to revisit with excitement.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Jianguomen neighborhood office in Dongcheng District, Beijing handed out items such as refrigerators as rewards for 12 low-income subsidy recipient families that voluntarily  surrendered their low-income subsidies.</seg>
<seg id="3"> (The Beijing News, July 10)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The author is happy about the improvements in life of these families. However, I have mixed feelings about the wording of "voluntary surrender of low-income subsidy" and the practice of "giving out rewards".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Vice-chairman of Jianguomen neighborhood office said, "In order to address problems including defrauding low-income subsidy and so on, encouraging voluntary surrender of low-income subsidy is to set an example for other low-income subsidy recipient households."</seg>
<seg id="6"> If this example encourages other low-income subsidy recipients to turn the corner through efforts of their own, then it is indeed worth promoting. However, if one wants to use this to "inspire" people who have been defrauding low-income subsidy for a long time, then it is somewhat naive.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The work to differentiate and straighten up real and false low-income subsidy recipient households should rely more on the law.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Relevant departments should strengthen responsibilities that low-income subsidy recipient households need to fulfill when enjoying low-income subsidy: For example, inform changes in number of family members and income in a timely manner, report employment situation, and subjected to regular review. Meanwhile, relevant departments should step up efforts in supervision and inspection.</seg>
<seg id="9"> After all, only the "surrender of low-income subsidy according to the law" is the long-term plan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Who pays for the material rewards given to families that surrender their low-income subsidies by the neighborhood office?</seg>
<seg id="11"> As a level-one government agency, the expenses of the neighborhood office are shouldered by financial appropriation.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Then, should this sum of taxpayers' money be spent?</seg>
<seg id="13"> On the one hand, families that surrender their low-income subsidies have proven that they have certain abilities to be 'self-sufficient". On the other hand, aren't there still people who apply for low-income subsidy?</seg>
<seg id="14"> Government appropriation that is labeled as life-saving money should render timely help instead of making what is good still better.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Liu Gangyi's 'I Am Willing to Serve Others' Remark More Credible</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> On July 10, Liu Gangyi, the first Secretary of the township Party committee publicly nominated and directly elected in the country and the Secretary of the Party committee of Mulan Town in Xindu District, Chengdu City was subjected to democratic evaluation for the fourth time since he took office. He had an approval rating of 97 percent.</seg>
<seg id="3"> In the conversation between Liu Gangyi and the reporter, Liu Gangyi defined himself as "one who serves others".</seg>
<seg id="4"> (Yesterday, the Beijing News)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The "one who serves others" that Liu Gangyi referred to is perhaps more truthful and convincing than "the one who serves others" referred to by some appointed cadres.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The biggest advantage of public nomination and direct election over appointment system is that it is mainly ordinary Party members and the people who determine the origin of the power of the former while the latter is mainly appointed by higher-level organizations, whereas the direction from which power originates has established that the former must give accountability to the people top priority.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The origin of power and to whom one is responsibleare fundamental factors in deciding how an electee conducts his work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Some people challenge that such a "democratic evaluation" is more like a "democracy show".</seg>
<seg id="9"> My opinion is that having such form of democratic evaluation is better than not having any.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Given considerations to the history and current situation of the building of democratic politics at the grassroots level in China, I believe that direct public election is already a major breakthrough. Democratic evaluation is an important component of this unprecedented undertaking. It should not be underestimated in the advancement of building democratic politics at the grassroots level.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> On June 23, Patil put her palms together before filling out the presidential candidate documents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The presidential election in India has begun on the 19th. The new president will emerge between the incumbent Vice President Shekawat and Pratibha Patil, the governor of Rajasthan who resigned not long ago.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Patil is the first female presidential candidate in India's history. If she is elected, she will become India's first woman president ever.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Patil is the presidential candidate of the ruling Congress Party while Shekawat is from the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Since the Congress Party has the upper hand in the presidential election, the media and the people all suspect that Patil has a relative high possibility of being elected.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Patil, 72, was the woman governor of Rajasthan.</seg>
<seg id="8"> She was a lawyer and joined the Congress in 1985. She is seasoned in politics. During her term as the governor of Rajasthan, she had received high opinions from the government.</seg>
<seg id="9"> She also devotes herself to social welfare and is the honorary chairman of many cultural, educational, and social welfare organizations.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Analysts pointed out that the reason Patil became the candidate was that she has pledged her allegiance steadfastly to Sonia Gandhi, the Chairman of the Congress Party.</seg>
<seg id="11"> In India, the Gandhi family has been controlling the ruling National Party for a long time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Patil has the support of many woman voters, who believe that Patil will rebuild the image of women and raise their status in India where the conception of discrimination against women is serious.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The Constitution stipulates that India is a federal state. The president is the ceremonial head of the state and the chief commander of the armed forces. He/she does not represent any party or organization and is more of a symbol.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> On July 1, the alarm bell in the Nanjing Jinghai Temple Memorial Hall was tolled again, giving out melodious chimes.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The heavy historical echo "connected" the Mainland with Hong Kong through television station. Residents of Nanjing shared the moment with Hong Kong compatriots from afar to celebrate the 10th Anniversary of the return of Hong Kong to its motherland together.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> At midnight on July 1 a decade ago, 155 alarming bell chimes reverberated in the sky above the bell tower of the Nanjing Jinghai Temple Memorial Hall, a farewell to the humiliating history of the ceding of Hong Kong Island.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> People from all circles in Nanjing gathered in front of the small memorial hall. They said that they wanted to toll the alarm bell with their own two hands to warn themselves and descendants never to forget about history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> "The alarm bell is 1.842 meters tall while 1842 was precisely when the Treaty of Nanjing was signed during the Opium War.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The shoulder of the bell is 1.997 meters tall and 1997 was the year when Hong Kong was returned to its motherland."</seg>
<seg id="8"> Wang Fengling, the person who designed and cast the alarm bell that very year, explained, "Five narrow patterns of the character 'wan' go around the body of the bell. The entire copper bell uses high relief with two dragons holding up the fireball to symbolize that Hong Kong is the 'Pearl of the Orient' of the motherland. In the end, plum blossom, the city flower of Nanjing, is used as contrasting patterns of the body of the bell."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Yu Xiaodong, member of the democratic party who was the first person to suggest building the alarm bell that very year, said with emotion, "Before you knew it, it has already been 10 years since Hong Kong was returned to the motherland." He hoped that the future of Hong Kong can be "bright, melodious, and continue forever" just like the bell chimes.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Borovkov, attorney of Russian magnate Berezovsky who is in exile in London, announced on July 2 that the Russian Federal Security Service has formally indicted his client with a new charge by accusing Berezovsky of "conspiring to stage a coup with an attempt to seize political power in Russia by force".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Borovkov said that during an interview with a reporter of the Guardian  in Britain this April, Berezovsky announced that he was preparing to mount a "palace coup" in Russia and confirmed that he was providing financial support to representatives of the Rightist elites who opposed to the policies of the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The Investigation Directorate of the Russian Federal Security Service immediately initiated a criminal case against Berezovsky under Article 278  "forcible seizure of power" of the Penal Code of the Russian Federation and formally filed a corresponding charge with Moscow's Savelovsky Court recently.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Allegedly, the Russian Office of the Prosecutor-General had filed a criminal charge against Berezovsky in February 2006 with the same evidence that the exiled tycoon confirmed in an interview his attempt to seize political power in Russia by force.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Since Berezovsky had been in exile ever since and could not be extradited, Russia temporarily terminated the investigation of the case in January 2007.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> On July 2, Moscow's Savelovsky Court began the hearing of another criminal case against the exiled magnate. The Russian Office of the Prosecutor-General charged Berezovsky with embezzling Russian airline Aeroflot of Â£214 million in capital and laundering Â£16 million. After hearing the evidence, the court decided to postpone the court investigation to July 12. It will assign a state-appointed defense attorney for the defendant here.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Berezovsky argued that these are all "farces" and clearly prohibited his defense attorney to take part in the court hearings.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Since this year, all departments across Guangxi have launched activities to change work style of cadres and enhance the buildup of administrative efficiency of government organs. They have implemented the "three systems" of responsibility by first contact, conclusion of business within time limit, and accountability. Thirty-three key approval departments directly under the autonomous region and 135 positions of responsibility are included in the administrative efficiency-monitoring network.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Up until now, 619 people had been held accountable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The reporter learned from the Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region on the 5th that currently, Guangxi has initially formed the three-leveled administrative efficiency monitoring network of autonomous region, cities, and counties to step up monitoring of key departments and positions of responsibility. The electronic monitoring systems of the 14 cities are all hooked up to the network of the autonomous region.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The electronic administrative efficiency monitoring system of the autonomous region is directly linked to 33 key approval departments directly under the autonomous region and 135 positions of responsibility that involve investment environment and production and living of the people to further standardize approval behaviors and increase approval efficiency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Meanwhile, all levels of discipline inspection and monitoring organs in Guangxi are strictly investigating cases that involve work style and efficiency, as well as damages to people's interests. Up until now, 1,104 cases have been investigated and verified, 769 of which had been closed while 584 units and 619 people had been held accountable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Ma Tieshan, Standing Committee member of the Party Committee and Secretary of the Commission for Discipline Inspection of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, said on the 5th that administrative efficiency monitoring is a task that always go with administrative activities. A mechanism with lasting effect should be gradually established.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Guangxi wants to further improve and standardize various regulations and systems of administrative management, to establish working and guarantee mechanisms to improve administrative efficiency monitoring, to put efficiency monitoring on the track of systemization and standardization, to further standardize monitoring and examination procedures, to strengthen and improve mechanisms to handle complaints and evaluate performance, to step up efforts in ascertaining responsibilities and to guarantee the implementation of working systems of responsibility by first contact and conclusion of business within time limit with strict system of accountability.</seg>

<seg id="2"> According to reports of U.S. media on the 15th, the number of reports on adverse reactions caused by diabetes drug Avandia such as heart attack has significantly increased in the United States in recent days.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a safety warning this May suggesting diabetics to take precaution in taking Avandia because scientists published a study report in the May 21 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine stating that this best-selling drug will greatly increase patients' risk of heart attack and death rate.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Doctors and patients thus paid close attention to the safety of Avandia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Statistics showed that within approximately a month after the safety warning was issued, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration received 357 reports on adverse reactions caused by Avandia, 38 of which were reports of death.</seg>
<seg id="6"> While in January and February this year, the Food and Drug Administration only received 50 and 73 cases of adverse reaction reports respectively.</seg>
<seg id="7"> These adverse reactions range from minor one of having blisters to serious one of sudden death from heart attack.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> However, drug experts at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration believed that it is now still too early to draw a conclusion that Avandia is unsafe.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> An official of the U.S. Department of Defense said on the 23rd that due to the War on Iraq and changes in global situation, the U.S. Department of Defense is reconsidering its plan to cut approximately half of the U.S. troops in Europe formulated in 2002.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> U.S. media quoted a Department of Defense official as saying that since the War on Iraq is still going on and the US-Russia and US-Iran relationships are deteriorating, the leadership at the Department of Defense raised doubts about the feasibility of the plan to cut the troops in Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In 2002, the then Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld announced that the United States would reduce the original 113,000 troops in Europe to 71,000 by 2012 in order to build a new "small and elite" army.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The number of U.S. troops in Europe is currently reduced to 100,000.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> However, Craddock, commander-in-chief of U.S. European Command, submitted a report to the current Secretary of Defense Gates in June questioning the above reduction plan.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The report said that while the U.S. troops in Europe are being reduced, many troops are be rotated into Iraq and Afghanistan to fight, thus causing a shortage in U.S. troops in Europe. As a result, they cannot cooperate normally with their European allies.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The report suggested a halt to the plan to cut U.S. troops in Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Relevant experts in the United States argued that the above phenomenon shows that the prolonged War on Iraq has disrupted the original adjustment plan of the U.S. army.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The first is its identification function.</seg>
<seg id="3"> An important mark to differentiate between armies of different countries, between different services and arms, and between the army and the civilians.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Even though army uniforms have basically the same use among armies of over 100 large and small countries in the world, no army uniforms of any two countries' armies are identical.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The second is its symbolic function.</seg>
<seg id="6"> To a certain extent, army uniform is a reflection of the spirit and distinctive feature of a nation. It also fully reflects the fighting ability and the soldiers' quality of a country's army.</seg>
<seg id="7"> In the three major types of army uniforms - dress uniform, service uniform, and combat and training uniform - there is nothing like the crisp and beautiful dress uniform that can fully display the might of the country and the army.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The third is its protective function.</seg>
<seg id="9"> With the rapid development in new and high-tech weapons and equipment, to enhance the comprehensive protective ability of new and high-tech combat and training uniforms so as to provide army uniforms with various functions including bulletproof, counter-reconnaissance, chemical-proof, germs-proof, radiation-proof, as well as temperature, dampness, and air adjustments has become the priority in the development of army uniforms.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> This newspaper, Chengdu, July 3</seg>
<seg id="3"> Reported by Qu Yimao, Yang Ruiyu: "We must thank the brigade's Party committee for its determination and courage in the eviction so that we can live in an apartment."</seg>
<seg id="4"> Today, more than 10 cadres of a communication training brigade in Chengdu Military Area Command who moved into apartments were all beaming with joy. They were full of respect and gratitude for the earnest and courageous way "the group" at the brigade Party Committee handled difficult issues.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> A few years ago, with personnel changes, some of the apartments in the residential building of the brigade were illegally occupied which caused a shortage in accommodation for cadres in active service. The officers and soldiers had quite a few complaints about it.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The brigade had tried evictions a few times before but due to various obstructions, nothing was settled every time, thus turning this into a complicated and long-pending problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "As long as one is persistent and reasonable, all problems can be resolved."</seg>
<seg id="8"> After the new Party committee group reached a consensus, the key leadership started to thoroughly straighten out all problems of illegal occupation of apartments themselves.</seg>
<seg id="9"> On the one hand, they resorted to emotional appeal through reasoning and hoped that the people involved would consider the big picture. At the same time, they clearly explained relevant policy stipulations on apartments, houses built by collected funds, and utility apartments of the army, and declared the Party committee's determination, principles and position.</seg>
<seg id="10"> For people who had housing elsewhere but were unwilling to return the illegally occupied housing, the Party committee immediately contacted the units to which they belonged and adopted corresponding measures to urge them to voluntarily cooperate with the work of the brigade.</seg>
<seg id="11"> After two months of meticulous work, all residents in the barrack site who had illegally occupied the apartments moved away on time. All cadres in the brigade who were in active service were given housing according to the rule.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The persistent and courageous work style of the brigade Party committee also created a chain effect. The few cadres who were unwilling to positively cooperate with the assignment of the organization in the beginning all indicated that they will follow the decision of the organization now.</seg>

<seg id="1"> People's Armed Forces Department of Jingjiang City Builds Platform to Elevate Qualities of People's Armed Forces Cadres</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> This newspaper, Reported by Staff Reporters Cao Jiawei, Zhu Chunbin: On June 18, in the training class for cadres of the Department of People's Armed Forces in Jingjiang City, Jiangsu Province, the tutorial To Win the Psychological Battle under Information Conditions taught by Lu Yuqing, chief of the Xilai County Department of People's Armed Forces, was well received by all students taking part in the training.</seg>
<seg id="3"> This was the new change brought about by the concentrated effort of the city's Department of People's Armed Forces to elevate the comprehensive qualities of the cadres of the Department of People's Armed Forces through charging them with heavy tasks in accordance with reality of their positions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In the beginning of the year, during grassroots research, the Party committee of the Department of People's Armed Forces found that some cadres of the People's Armed Forces had long term of service and held too many concurrent duties, thus failed to focus their energy on doing armed forces work.</seg>
<seg id="5"> To this end, they adopted measures including centralized training, coaching seminars, and reliance on training offered by local Party schools to provide regular training to cadres of the Department of People's Armed Forces and concentrated efforts on resolving issues including the narrow range of knowledge and one-dimensional professional qualifications of the cadres of the Department of People's Armed Forces.</seg>
<seg id="6"> They integrated central tasks and boldly assigned duties to cadres of the Department of People's Armed Forces, charged them with heavy tasks, and elevated their work abilities through on-the-job training.</seg>
<seg id="7"> At the same time, they actively coordinated with local organizations and departments and jointly formulated the Program for Cadres of the Department of People's Armed Forces to Compete for Job Positions that clearly stipulated that chiefs of the Department of Armed Forces must join the team of Party committee at the same level and not to hold other concurrent duties;</seg>
<seg id="8"> they established the adjustment and exchange mechanism for cadres of the Department of People's Armed Forces. For cadres of the Department of People's Armed Forces who are relatively old and cannot adapt to grassroots armed forces work, they made adjustments and exchanges immediately. For compatriots who had good comprehensive qualities and strong work abilities, they promoted and employed them.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Not long ago, Chen Yisong, Secretary of the New Century Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. Department of People's Armed Forces, led the technical detachment of the militiamen in the innovative development of underwater ship welding technology that filled the gap in the country.

<seg id="1"> Good Start Still Needs to See Things Through</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The 2-2 score was reasonable and was acceptable to the Chinese team if judging from the result of the game alone. The key was that the process of the game was somewhat regrettable.</seg>
<seg id="3"> If the Iranian team led by 2-0, then the Chinese team tied the score, that would definitely make Chinese fans feel very differently. It would bolster a lot of morale. Unfortunately, the situation was precisely the opposite.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Fails to see things through can be considered as an old problem of the Chinese team.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The Chinese team never knows how to play under excellent situation. The general opinion is that mentally Chinese players are not tough enough.</seg>
<seg id="6"> This is indeed a reason that the Chinese team fails to "see things through".</seg>
<seg id="7"> However, judging from the game that the Chinese team played today, it seems that it is not necessarily so.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Not only had Sun Jihai, Sun Xiang, Shao Jiayi, and Zheng Zhi played in Europe before, Li Weifeng and the others are also battle-hardened veterans. They are experienced and knowledgeable. Theoretically, there should not be any problem with their mental qualities.</seg>
<seg id="9"> This time, the Chinese team was regrettably pressed to tie with the Iranian team. The reason was probably the ineffectiveness in moving players on the field.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The Iranian team substituted two people while they were trailing behind and the situation was immediately improved.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The Chinese team also substituted three players in the second half but the outcome was not good.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> In order to overcome the problem of not seeing things through, one must find the root of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="13"> As long as one identifies the problem, means to resolve it is probably not hard to find.</seg>
<seg id="14"> The only worrisome thing is to try to find a cure indiscriminately for an emergency.</seg>
<seg id="15"> If the situation continues like this, no matter how many more games the Chinese team plays, it will still commit the same mistake. The continuous progress that people expect as it plays more games will be out of the question.</seg>

<seg id="2"> This newspaper, reported by Xue Bingjian, Reporter Xu Yeqing: The phenomena of difficult organization, limited resources, and lack of coordination in education encountered by small, scattered, remote, and independent units will become history for a base of the Second Artillery.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The reporters recently learned that after half a year of pilot, the base promulgated the Enactment Measures to Implement Ideological and Political Education Syllabus that cover several ideological and political education cooperation zones in all small, scattered, remote, and independent units at the base. The measures are officially in operation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In order to promote the effective implementation of the Ideological and Political Education Syllabus, the base allocated resources to conduct an in-depth survey on the ideological and political education situation in small, scattered, remote, and independent units in the beginning of the year. They sorted out key issues that affected and restricted the time, personnel, and effects of the education and initially formed the new educational model of cooperation zones for small, scattered, remote, and independent units.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The details of the cooperation zones are, break away from the restrictions of authorized force of the units, and designate a unit at the brigade or regiment level in a sub-area where small, scattered, remote, and independent units are relatively concentrated to take the lead to conduct standardized planning of thematic education. Units under different affiliations will attend classes together nearby or to hold long-distance discussions by means of video system.</seg>
<seg id="6"> They adopt the practice of integrating teaching rotation and competing for job positions to conduct consolidated allocation of education force. Education hardware in the sub-area is put under centralized use. Information and data of all units, as well as education experiences are shared and exchanged. Report tours by model sub-areas and sharing of educational experiences among officers and men are regularly organized.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Each cooperation unit has set up full-time education contacts and part-time education information gatherers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> On this foundation, all cooperation zones have also established systems for seeking help in difficult questions, discussions on major educational topics, notification of emergency ideological situations, and examination and assessment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Zhang Shengmin, chief of the Political Department at the base, told reporters that the establishment of political education cooperation zones both reduces waste in educational resources and deepens educational effects.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Some political instructors worry that they will lose points in front of officers and men from outside units, so they take the initiative to learn new knowledge and explore new educational methods.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Officers and men being taught also actively digest educational contents in fear that they will sound unprofessional in front of officers and men from neighboring units during discussion, differentiation, and analysis.</seg>
<seg id="12"> In this case, the enthusiasm of both the educators and the ones who receive the education is effectively stimulated.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> This newspaper</seg>
<seg id="3"> Reported by Wang Weiqin, Special Correspondent Li Deying: On July 25, the reporters saw at the combat support company of a unit under the Jinan Military Command that a notification board with important matters including calls for bids on projects of the unit, financial expenses, promotions of cadres, and admittance of warrant officers to the Party written on it was hung at an eye-catching spot in the display window.</seg>
<seg id="4"> According to Political Commissar Su Chengsen, this is a concrete measure that the unit adopts to advance the system of open work style.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Early this year, in order to strengthen the building of Party's style and of a clean government, the Party committee of this unit formulated measures including the Two-Way Supervision between State Organs and Grassroots and the Notification of the Public on Sensitive Matters. They requested decisions on major issues that involve personal interests of officers and soldiers and the building of the unit to be made after seeking opinions from grassroots soldiers as well as disclosure of the entire course of work including standards applied, procedures, and results based on the situation.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The unit has set up a suggestion box and notification board, as well as established a "message board" on the LAN to gather opinions and suggestions of the people on a large scale.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The soldiers' dormitory renovation project began at the beginning of the year. Before the project started, the Party committee solicited opinions from officers and soldiers extensively and then released bidding information and implemented open bidding.</seg>

<seg id="9"> Openness and fairness in work has promoted the formation of good morals at grassroots.</seg>
<seg id="10"> In this unit, whether they are major matters such as determination of central and sensitive issues or minor matters such as going home to visit relatives or taking vacation of an individual and daily expenses on food accounts, the grassroots companies still insist on notifying and announcing the matters regularly and subjecting to public monitoring conscientiously.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, London, July 2 - Icelandic scientists' research revealed that people who have two gene mutations in their bodies have a much higher risk of suffering from atrial fibrillation than normal people do.</seg>
<seg id="3"> According to report of the latest issue of the journal Nature, researchers of Iceland-based deCODE Genetics Inc. obtained the above finding after conducting screening of genes of several thousand people from Iceland, Sweden, the United States, and China's Hong Kong region.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The two genes discovered by the scientists are located close to a gene that plays an important role in early heart development.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Atrial fibrillation is the quivering of the heart. It is one of the most common types of clinical cardiac arrhythmia that can cause heart palpitations, shortness of breath, fatigue, and stroke.</seg>
<seg id="6"> In addition, according to report of the Nature Genetics journal published on the 1st, researchers of deCODE Genetics Inc. also identified two genes that link to prostate cancer on human chromosome 17. They play certain role in more than one third of prostate cancer cases.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Maracaibo (Venezuela), July 3 (Reporter Liu Jian)</seg>
<seg id="3"> According to report of Venezuelan media on the 3rd, during an interview here, the 37-year-old veteran goalkeeper of the U.S. team Keller stated that if he cannot find a suitable club to play for after the Copa America, then he will choose to retire.</seg>
<seg id="4"> "If four or six weeks after the Copa America ends I still can't strike a deal with a top level football team that would allow me to play another season or two then retirement may be a good choice."</seg>
<seg id="5"> With Moenchengladbach relegated to Germany's Second Division, Keller also left the team that he had played for for more than two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Even though Keller intends to retire, he, who is "yet to be married off", apparently is not worried about the next employer. He said frankly himself that currently, as many as eight clubs intend to invite him to join them.</seg>
<seg id="7"> However, the veteran goalkeeper, who had played in the Spain's First Division League, the English Premier League, and the Germany's First Division League, stated that his final decision rests on his family, "My child is nine years old already and he followed me to three different countries and studied in three different schools. My choice now must seek what's the best for my family."</seg>
<seg id="8"> In the Gold Cup Final that just ended recently, Keller had a stellar performance and helped the U.S. team won the championship.</seg>
<seg id="9"> In the Copa America this year, he was still entrusted with important task by head coach Bradley. However, one man alone cannot win. The U.S. team, which went to battle with "young guards", was simply no match for strong South American teams such as Argentina and Paraguay. The goal that he kept was penetrated seven times in two games.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The next game against the Colombian team will very probably be the last performance of the U.S. team and Keller in this year's Copa America.</seg>

<seg id="4"> As a man on the street, when I heard this, I couldn't help laughing.  When the police are catching thieves, do they tell the thieves a month in advance, hurry and voluntarily confess, otherwise we'll catch you?  What kind of corruption fighting is that???</seg>
<seg id="5"> Isn't this just the same as explicitly telling corrupt officials in advance to get running and quickly shift the incriminating evidence???</seg>
<seg id="6"> What's the point in that?</seg>
<seg id="7"> It'll definitely...Oh, I simply don't have the words.</seg>
<seg id="8"> To look at it another way, even if it really does work, how effective will it be?</seg>
<seg id="9"> Will it be able to inhibit and deter corrupt officials?</seg>
<seg id="10"> We don't exclude the possibility that there will be cowards among them who will come and voluntarily confess, but won't there definitely be more who run?</seg>
<seg id="11"> And regardless of whether or not there has been a significant result when the CCDI's anti-corruption deadline has arrived, but it might have served another purpose.</seg>
<seg id="12"> That is that corrupt officials everywhere have all got the message and privately rejoice.  They will all thank the CCDI.</seg>
<seg id="13"> One month is enough time to quickly transfer your assets.</seg>
<seg id="14"> If I were a corrupt official, I would absolutely be thinking this as well and I would absolutely not go to you to voluntarily declare them, either.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Apart from celebrating their luck, corrupt officials will all be saying this: haha, thanks very much...</seg>
<seg id="16"> Ordinary people honestly can't understand it at all, what's with this corruption fighting?  Why is it so hard to just enforce it quickly and effectively, to take decisive action?</seg>

<seg id="6"> I've also always had a great deal of trust and sincere expectations of the central Party.  No matter how much their reform measures didn't fit with my ideas, I could accept them all, and see this as one of their "characteristics."</seg>
<seg id="7"> But as soon as land starts to be privatized (or covertly privatized), the existing basis of all this will be lost.</seg>
<seg id="8"> It is better to lose a thousand soldiers than to give up an inch of land.  Our national land resources are indeed our greatest social resources.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The working people and the national land resources are the roots of a nation.</seg>
<seg id="10"> If only the character of the national land resources doesn't change, the character of the nation will not very easily alter.  As soon as the character of the national land resources changes, then basically everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="11"> I'm not a member of the Communist Party, but I remember clearly that I have sworn this oath: "I love the motherland, I love the people; I will study well and keep myself fit, to prepare for: contributing my effort to the cause of communism!"</seg>
<seg id="12"> "I will study diligently, work hard, put hard work before leisure, and struggle for the cause of communism!"</seg>
<seg id="13"> Those people who like me have sworn these oaths and have loudly sung, "We are the heirs of socialism," should be able to remember the oaths they have made if they are not too shameless.</seg>
<seg id="14"> If you have broken your own oath, then please honestly stand up and leave the side of "communism."  Don't hoax the masses holding on to this placard, while thinking about how to sell the placard for a good price.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Of course, I hope that all of these worries are needless.  I hope that I will be able to maintain my reasonableness and calm always.</seg>
<seg id="16"> You should remember, "We are the heirs of socialism."</seg>
<seg id="17"> If there's nothing to inherit, what do we do then?</seg>

<seg id="1"> One Generation, Experience of Two Eras</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A while ago, someone asked: are there any thirty-year-old Mao supporters?</seg>
<seg id="3"> Later, it was changed to twenty-year-olds.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Actually people of this age group didn't experience the Mao Zedong era at all.  I don't know if the person who asked this question has had their brains washed away or if they were born dumb.</seg>
<seg id="5"> In the cities, those with the most right to talk about the Mao Zedong era should be those who experienced those years for themselves.  It's the people who suffered the torments of +those years.  That is to say, it should be people who were born between 1950 and 1960.</seg>
<seg id="6"> After they were born, their parents were taking part in campaigns and didn't give their children the appropriate love.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Just when they needed nutrition, they landed in three years of natural disaster and suffered the hardships of hunger.</seg>
<seg id="8"> When they started school, again they met with the Cultural Revolution, and several years of their education were wasted.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Some of them even terminated their education forever.  When they were 15-17 years old, and had not finished their education, they were forced to abandon their studies and respond to the call of the Party to go into remote areas and villages and to reinforce the border areas.</seg>
<seg id="10"> After they started work, they thought that the laboring class was the most honorable, so they voluntarily chose the dirtiest and hardest work.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Their honor was short-lived; their mediocrity stuck with them for a lifetime.</seg>
<seg id="12"> When they were old enough to get married, getting married late, having children late and having only one child started with them.</seg>
<seg id="13"> +When they should have been getting +raises, the companies valued diplomas.  Because they didn't have diplomas, the +raises didn't come.</seg>
<seg id="14"> They worked hard to bring up their children and give their children a full basic education.  When their children got into universities, they met with the double whammy of reform in the education system and reform of the state-owned enterprises.  Tuition fees went up, and they were laid off.</seg>
<seg id="15"> As their age increased day by day, they started to get ill, and again they were unlucky in meeting with the reform of the healthcare system.  This meant that their diseased bodies couldn't get treatment because they couldn't pay the medical bills.</seg>
<seg id="16"> We can see that all of the unfairness in society fell mercilessly on the people of their generation.</seg>
<seg id="17"> But among these people there aren't many who are against Mao Zedong or who attack Mao Zedong.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Why?</seg>
<seg id="19"> They're not Mao Zedong's slaves.  They're flesh and blood, living right here among the people and groups of our society.  The history of their personal experiences, from going to the remote areas and villages to being laid off from their jobs, encapsulates the social phenomena of two eras.</seg>
<seg id="20"> Even though they are very unhappy about or even hate their wasted education, not having enough to eat, not having warm clothes, and some bad social phenomena during the Mao Zedong era, they still think the Mao Zedong era was good in terms of the national spirit, morality in personal relationships, and social practices</seg>
<seg id="21"> The parents of some of you netizens are precisely people of this generation.  You can chat about it with them.</seg>

<seg id="1"> "Injected Watermelons," "Cancer Bananas," and "Cardboard Buns"</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Posted by [Wasteland Beyond the Great Wall] at 2007-07-19 22:02:57 [send a message] [full view] I remember there was news two years ago of watermelons in Hainan being injected with chemical drugs by someone using a syringe.  The result was that a load of Hainan watermelons rotted in the field, and a lot of watermelon farmers got no return on their expenses.</seg>
<seg id="3"> CCTV later did a follow-up report, and it turned out that they proved there had never been any such thing.</seg>
<seg id="4"> This report was weird from the beginning, because if you wanted to inject large watermelons with a syringe one by one, it would not only have no real point, it would also be impossible because of the amount of work.</seg>
<seg id="5"> My memory from last year is clearer.  There were reports in the media saying that banana trees in Hainan were suffering from a disease similar to human cancer, and that the diseased banana trees were very likely to die.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The result was that it was misunderstood by lots of people to be that if you ate bananas you'd get cancer.  The result was the same again.  The price of Hainan bananas dropped steeply, making the banana farmers cry till they had no more tears left and complain on and on.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The reason why the two reports above both caused such a stir was because they directly touched on people's most sensitive nerve, i.e. the issue of food safety.</seg>
<seg id="8"> If the media says such-and-such a food may threaten our health, then it will definitely get relayed ten times, and those ten times relayed a hundred times.  Towards the subject involved, people generally prefer to take an attitude of better to believe it than not.  For a single person, eating a few less Hainan watermelons, bananas, etc., is no big deal, after all.  But for the producers and sellers of those products, the impact gets very big.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Not long ago, another storm burst in Beijing over food safety.  It was that people had gone so far as to use processed cardboard boxes as the filling when making buns because the price of pork had gone up.  These were "cardboard buns."</seg>
<seg id="10"> When I heard this I was also deeply shocked.  I thought these stallholders have an amazing ability to find new tricks, if they've managed to think up this kind of method to cheat people.  Moreover, I then passed on this piece of news to many people and warned my family and friends not to buy any more buns when they go out on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="11"> But yesterday there was suddenly another piece of news saying that the cardboard buns report was fake news, and the whole thing was made up by one person.  Now at the same time as I'm feeling relieved I'm also very puzzled.  What on earth is with the media these days?</seg>
<seg id="12"> The facts of the matter that I've found out from reliable sources are: a temporary employee of the program "Transparency" on the Beijing TV lifestyle channel, Zi something, took some pork filling himself that he'd bought from the market, flour and cardboard, and instructed Wei someone and other people to soak the cardboard in water, mix it into the pork filling, and make it into buns.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Zi something used a domestic digital video camera that he'd taken to record the manufacturing process, then edited it and used tricks to get it broadcast.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Now the police have already detained the criminal suspect Zi someone in accordance with the law, and will deal with him severely in accordance with the law.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Since the bun incident occurred, the government has quickly organized the relevant departments to launch an investigation, and is conducting a thorough, comprehensive probe into Beijing's breakfast market to guarantee safety on the public's dining tables.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Since the truth of the incident was confirmed, Beijing TV has made a public apology to the public and has learned an important lesson.  It has investigated and dealt with the relevant responsible people severely, and will further strengthen management, stop up leak points, and resolutely put an end to false and untrue news reports.</seg>
<seg id="17"> But even though the cardboard buns were pure fabrications, when everyone will dare to go again with confidence to the stalls to buy buns is as yet an unknown.</seg>
<seg id="18"> This incident also reflects from one perspective the importance that the government places on food safety and the speed of its action.  And to an extent it also shows that the dining tables of the Beijing public are still fairly safe.  The false alarm of the bun incident has also been a reminder for everyone!</seg>

<seg id="1"> To Whom Do We Owe a Duty in Education?</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Recently I've heard friends back home talking about some news from a school, and I have to have my say about this.</seg>
<seg id="3"> It all happened at a private middle school in Shanghai - South West Weiyu Middle School.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The school decided to arrange the best teachers for three classes of students from the school's own junior middle school who had signed contracts on direct admission to the senior middle school.  And it got some young teachers with unimpressive teaching records and no experience of teaching high school seniors to teach some other classes which had been admitted from other schools after examination or had not signed contracts for admission to this school.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The reason was: the students who signed contracts agreed at that time not to take the examinations for other senior middle schools, so the school must guarantee the best teachers for them according to the agreement.</seg>
<seg id="6"> And the school's attitude to the students in other classes was: you should give young teachers the opportunity to gain experience.</seg>
<seg id="7"> This couldn't but make me wonder, to whom do we really owe a duty in education?</seg>
<seg id="8"> I remember when I studied at a key senior middle school many years ago, all of the students in my class were unhappy with the quality of one math teacher's teaching.  Despite the complexity of things, we collectively signed a request that the school change our teacher.</seg>
<seg id="9"> In the end, the school really did give us another teacher, because the school's promise to us was that it would treat every student equally, that it would do its duty by every student.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Ten years ago I came to the US to study for a postgraduate degree.</seg>
<seg id="11"> One summer, when I was choosing my courses for the next semester, I found that all the elective courses the department had arranged were all heavily theoretical courses, and they hadn't arranged any of some more practical courses.</seg>
<seg id="12"> I went to talk to the head of the department and told him I thought there was a problem with the curriculum.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The head of the department admitted that the reason the curriculum did not include any practical courses was because of a lack of teachers.  In one or two years when they had teachers, they would be able to offer them.</seg>
<seg id="14"> I remember I said to him then: "This is your problem, not mine.</seg>
<seg id="15"> The reason I came halfway round the world from Shanghai to study at this school was because I was attracted by the introduction of your curriculum.</seg>
<seg id="16"> If you can't offer these courses, then don't put them in the introduction, otherwise it's false advertising.  It's failing to do your duty by me and my family."</seg>
<seg id="17"> After listening to what I said, the department head thought for a while and then said, Well, I'll see what we can do to solve this.</seg>
<seg id="18"> It may be already too late, because all of the courses have already been arranged and registered online.</seg>
<seg id="19"> Three weeks later, the head of department came to talk to me, basically to tell me that his work was to take care of every student, including me.</seg>
<seg id="20"> He had listened to my advice and made his best efforts.  He had added two practical electives, and hoped I could understand.</seg>
<seg id="21"> After this happened, I took a few courses taught by the head of department.</seg>
<seg id="22"> He never showed any bias against me because I'd complained to him.  In every class he very fairly gave me an A.</seg>
<seg id="23"> The night before graduation, I heard his secretary say that he did everything he could for every student, but not all the students were grateful to him.</seg>
<seg id="24"> During the graduation ceremony, when I was making a speech on behalf of the honors students, I told the head of department: all of us in our hearts appreciated everything he'd done for us, because he had done all he could to do his duty by everyone of us.</seg>
<seg id="25"> I felt that I had made the right choice in life by coming to this school.</seg>
<seg id="26"> As I said this, I saw a glint of tears in the department head's eyes...If one day every education worker in China and the whole education system can do their duty by every single student, then I think China's golden age won't be far away.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Central NY Men's 4s Volleyball Tournament</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Last Sunday I took part in the Central NY Men's 4s Volleyball Tournament.  I played for six and a half hours, and in the end our team won the championship.</seg>
<seg id="3"> This tournament was actually a warm-up tournament organized as preparation for taking part in the volleyball tournament at the summer sports games in New York(Empire State Games).</seg>
<seg id="4"> The coach split up Central NY's four participating men's teams (the high-school team, the college team, the over-35s team and the over-45s team) and rearranged them into four-person teams, with a setter in each team, and started the matches.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The tournament rules were a lot of fun.  You could only do back row attacks, you couldn't dink the ball inside the three-meter line, only one setter was allowed to block, and there were no substitutions.</seg>
<seg id="6"> So basically it was a test of spiking power and judgment and blocking in defense.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Our team had a 2m opposite hitter, who was both our strongest man and our tallest man in attack.  He took care of 60% of our attacks and points in the tournament.  One 1.85m setter solo blocked at the net and roofed a lot of attacks.</seg>
<seg id="8"> A 1.90m middle hitter made quite a few mistakes in attack because he was in the back row.</seg>
<seg id="9"> And then there was me, a 1.75m spiker, making the occasional sneak attack, with a quite acceptable success rate.  I mainly received the other team's cross-court spikes.</seg>
<seg id="10"> There were seven teams in total.  First was a round robin.  After my team won one match, the referee kept judging that our opposite hitter had fouled by stepping on the line while spiking.  This had a big impact on our morale, and in no time we'd lost three matches in a row.</seg>
<seg id="11"> But after we'd lost, everyone calmed down, and our teamwork also came together during these three matches, so we started a winning streak.</seg>
<seg id="12"> After the round robin, my team had won three, lost three.  Because of our low scores, we were in 6th position.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Then we started the playoffs.  Apart from the team in first place, all the teams placed 2 through 7 played against one another in the elimination round.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Our team was psychologically and tactically settled, so we played hard and took no prisoners.  We led all the way and got into the semi-finals.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Our opponents in the semi-finals were good in attack but weak in defense.  My arms got beaten black and blue, but when I did manage to save a hard spike, the level of satisfaction was twice that I got by scoring from spiking the ball myself.</seg>
<seg id="16"> I didn't even know what the final score was when we won.</seg>
<seg id="17"> The opponents in the final had balanced attack and defense.  Our serves broke a lot of their attacks, and we led from the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Finally we had match point at 21-24, and our opponents made two serves in a row that I couldn't control.  At 23-24 our opposite hitter came over and said to me, it doesn't matter, it's only two shots.</seg>
<seg id="19"> The next shot came flying at me again, but it was okay, I passed it quite well, the setter back-passed it to the opposite hitter, and a hard spike finished the competition.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Another Thing about Morality</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> I've already said a lot about morality for isolated free individuals.</seg>
<seg id="3"> On this subject I haven't got anything worth repeating.</seg>
<seg id="4"> What I want to say now concerns groups.</seg>
<seg id="5"> We often meet situations that require groups.</seg>
<seg id="6"> In these situations, there is a need for groups to have some morality.</seg>
<seg id="7"> We can often find some very good morals in groups that have achieved success.</seg>
<seg id="8"> This is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Because for these causes or activities, we need to overcome some of the difficulties before us, to pull together, rid ourselves of those elements based on faith.  I think it's those good morals that also play a role that can't be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="10"> At the very least, a group of people with very low moral standards will find it very difficult to complete any successful major project together.  This can be predicted with great confidence.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Perhaps it is because the wisdom that enables one to see the long term interests with reasoned and forward vision is a necessary quality for success in a group.</seg>
<seg id="12"> In reality, groups often use all kinds of methods to obtain an identity, for example, logos, jargon, beliefs, etc. etc., and also morality.</seg>

<seg id="1"> [Discussion] How Many Times in Your Life Have You Been Truly Happy?</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A good friend of mine from senior middle school has finally got her visa and will set out at the end of August for a top school on the west coast of the USA to study for a postgraduate degree.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Today a few people from my school got together, and we were truly glad for her.  At last she'd got what she wanted.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Seeing her so happy, I was really envious.</seg>
<seg id="5"> I thought, I'm all grown up, but I've only been that happy the time I passed my exams to get into senior middle school.  At the time I'd never thought I'd be able to get into the well-known school ranked first or second in the entire city.  Later, I went predictably on to go to college and get a job.  In all that time I was never so happy again.</seg>
<seg id="6"> When I passed the exams to get into college, it wasn't the one I'd aimed for before, so you couldn't say I was particularly happy.</seg>
<seg id="7"> During my time at college, the only thing that kept me going was that after graduating I could go up north and get together with a guy who I'd been in love with for two years.</seg>
<seg id="8"> But fate always intervenes, and a month before I graduated, he broke up with me.  All of my fantasies from before collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Later I just went back to the north to work.  Now I've been working for nearly two years, and I've made enough money for a mid-range car, but I haven't ever felt that happy again.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Chatting with my good friend today, I was really able to feel her happiness.  Having slaved in preparation for a year, beside herself with worry, she has finally succeeded in getting abroad, and is going to start a new life.  That feeling of a dream coming true really makes one very happy.</seg>
<seg id="11"> I haven't planned to carry on studying, and I don't like living overseas either, because I worked overseas for half a year before, and found that life abroad doesn't actually suit me.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Having seen how happy my friend was, I couldn't help thinking, what are my goals?</seg>
<seg id="13"> What can make me that happy again?</seg>
<seg id="14"> Perhaps it's finding someone who really loves me, and is willing to stay with me for the rest of our lives.</seg>
<seg id="15"> I think at that time I'll be excited enough to cry, just as my good friend said to me, when she passed the embassy interview and got her clearance certificate, she couldn't stop herself crying.  A year of hard work and worry had finally been rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="16"> And me?</seg>
<seg id="17"> In relationships, I've given the most meticulous care, putting my heart into it over and over.  When will I also get what I want, and cry for happiness?</seg>
<seg id="18"> Perhaps I'm just a loser.  I've never worried about my career, but what about my love life?</seg>
<seg id="19"> When will my love life sort itself out?</seg>
<seg id="20"> I've always felt down on this issue.</seg>
<seg id="21"> What about you, all you boys and girls?</seg>
<seg id="22"> How many times in your lives have you been truly happy?</seg>

<seg id="1"> A Big Advertisement for the School of Architecture, South East University</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Haha, and this also counts as letting SEU alumni know what's going on at the School of Architecture.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The latest first-hand news, plus my own comments -- Refund guaranteed if it's fake.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Dean Wang, Secretary An, Professor Li of the personnel office, as well as several other lecturers from the architectural technology and science teaching and research office, attended the presentation.  I talked for an hour, and then everyone discussed it for about an hour and a half.</seg>
<seg id="5"> After the official presentation finished, Professor Zhang (assistant to the dean of the school) pulled me aside and said to me, let's go into the back office, shut the door and have a talk.</seg>
<seg id="6"> He was extremely friendly.  He closed the door and told me that at formal meetings there are some things that it's better not to say.  He said that it was clear that I had no basic idea about my future income, and then told me some specifics about the incomes of lecturers at the School of Architecture to stop me worrying.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Dean Wang had given an overview of the School of Architecture before the presentation.  He said that there were six key architecture-related programs in total across the country.  There are two at SEU, two at Tsinghua, one at Tongji, and one at Tianjin Univ.  There are none apart from these.</seg>
<seg id="8"> He said that in the past few years the State has laid a special emphasis on conserving energy resources in building, "green" architecture, and architectural science and technology, and that SEU wanted to bring in a lecturer in this area.</seg>
<seg id="9"> He said they'd received over 20 resumes that came in one after another, applying for this position.  There were locals, there were Japanese, there were Americans (apparently just one: me).</seg>
<seg id="10"> The School of Architecture saw this as very important, and examined the applicants very carefully.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Compared with some of the other architecture schools in colleges that I know, SEU really is pretty cutting edge.  Tongji's urban planning is probably a shade better than SEU, but it seems that SEU may still be a little ahead in terms of architectural design (This is something I hadn't realized before.)</seg>
<seg id="12"> Dean Wang said that in the last two years the School of Architecture's funding had been more than adequate.  It was one of the key schools being developed in the National 985 Project.</seg>
<seg id="13"> He told me that last year, the government gave lump-sum funding of 10 million in development expenses to the SEU SoA.  Of this, 3.5 million was spent directly on buying books to enrich the School of Architecture's specialist library (haha, even I want to give a big thumbs up to this: a generous deed!</seg>
<seg id="14"> ).  The rest of it was almost all used buying equipment for experiments in my field.</seg>
<seg id="15"> It's said that this aroused complaints from several Academicians.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Haha - by the way, I think they seem to have been ripped off on some imported equipment.</seg>
<seg id="17"> There's one test system for measuring how airtight a room is.  In America it's very common.  I reckon you could definitely get it for 500 US dollars.  But it turns out that SEU spent 50,000 renminbi on it!!!</seg>
<seg id="18"> There's some other things, too.  A lot of colleges and departments at SEU have now moved to the new campus at Jiulong Lake, but the School of Architecture insists on staying.  It says it wants to give the students a good architectural environment.  The old campus still has some classic architecture for them to see, whereas the new campus doesn't have anything.</seg>
<seg id="19"> Haha - It seems like the School of Architecture has also requested and obtained another building because the other departments have all moved out.</seg>
<seg id="20"> So Dean Wang said straight out to me that in future he would be able to give me my own office.</seg>
<seg id="21"> I'm extremely embarrassed: when Dean Wang said this, I didn't have even the slightest reaction.</seg>
<seg id="22"> Later, Professor Zhang pulled me aside and told me that this was not easy to get, because offices were in extremely short supply.  Some of the senior professors didn't even have their own offices.</seg>
<seg id="23"> This made me feel very unsettled.  It seems I still don't, ah, understand the situation in this country.</seg>
<seg id="24"> Overall, I've had a very pleasant trip to SEU.  The senior faculty and connected lecturers at the SEU School of Architecture have shown themselves to be extremely professional and hospitable, and have made a very good impression on me.</seg>
<seg id="25"> I hope everything goes well for SEU in its development, and may the School of Architecture continue to maintain its leading position!</seg>

<seg id="5"> At a press conference yesterday, she admitted frankly that it was the most tiring journey she had ever made.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The weather in that area is scorching, the drinking water dirty, and when she visited a market she encountered people at a protest angrily throwing stones.  Even riding on a camel she was scratched by the saddle.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Throughout the journey there was mishap after mishap, making her scream to herself several times, "I really want to go home!"</seg>
<seg id="8"> Shock at seeing the children's malnutrition</seg>
<seg id="9"> Having taken part in World Vision's campaigns to care for poor children for the past three consecutive years, Stephanie Sun calls herself an experienced spokesperson.</seg>
<seg id="10"> She took 30 bottles of vitamins, 40 flashlights, and 500 sweets to share with the local children.</seg>
<seg id="11"> She said that having accumulated a lot of experience, she knew that no matter how many little gifts she took, they would never be enough.</seg>
<seg id="12"> In Niger, the most serious problem is that mothers have no understanding of the issues involved in child raising, so the children suffer from serious malnutrition.</seg>
<seg id="13"> On the eight-hour car journey from the capital of Niger to the small town of Dara 500 kilometers away, Stephanie Sun experienced a sandstorm rarely seen in the area.</seg>
<seg id="14"> The wind blew sand and brought rain, and the whole sky changed colors with the wind and clouds.</seg>
<seg id="15"> The Jeep they were riding in shook more and more in the wind.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Recalling that moment, Stephanie Sun shuddered at the memory, revealing that even though she was in the car, she was very afraid.</seg>
<seg id="17"> She only relaxed a little when she later heard local people explaining that the sandstorm was a sign of good luck, bringing rain and moisture to the soil.</seg>
<seg id="18"> With local residents.</seg>
<seg id="19"> Pained by mothers' problems raising children</seg>
<seg id="20"> When she arrived at Dara, local officials held a dromedary welcome ceremony and invited Stephanie Sun to sit on the camel and be cheered by the local people.</seg>
<seg id="21"> But the camel was scared by the flashes and got completely out of control, nearly throwing Stephanie Sun to the ground.</seg>
<seg id="22"> Finally Stephanie Sun jumped down herself, but her clothes were accidentally got ripped by a hook on the saddle which scratched her arm, leaving a small bloody streak about eight centimeters long.</seg>
<seg id="23"> On this trip, Stephanie Sun visited four sick local children with severe malnourishment.  One of them was a baby four months old, weighing just 2.1 kilograms.  It didn't look like a person at all.</seg>
<seg id="24"> She said: "When I saw him, my heart ached.  His condition was really so extreme.  But it must also be the mother's problem.  We should teach them correct ideas about nutrition."</seg>

<seg id="3"> The goal of education is: to make the educated more able to live in and enjoy the existing social environment.</seg>
<seg id="4"> "Live" everyone can easily understand, but perhaps everyone has just understood "enjoy" as simply "have fun."  Actually, that's not right.  The scope of "enjoy" here is very broad.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Live: this includes the strengthening of the body and the strengthening of the mind.</seg>
<seg id="6"> 1. Strengthening of the body: through various forms of physical %pw, increase +physical strength, improve coordination, bring about steady improvement in sporting ability, so that you can meet the need for sufficient physical exercise and the needs of engaging with society.</seg>
<seg id="7"> 2. Strengthening of the mind: to be able to recognize more clearly the society in which you find yourself, to know yourself, to learn to engage with other people, to learn the ability to adapt yourself as you live and to experience and enjoy.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Above I've explained the goals of education, but the connection with this essay isn't very strong.  Now I'll talk about the key point: the key to Chinese education - humanize it</seg>

<seg id="1"> Club Original Writing: a Few Common Stages in Learning about Buffett</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Club original writing: a few common stages in learning about Buffett: I'm Strolling</seg>
<seg id="3"> 1) Stage one: introduction to Buffett.  You have a feeling of finally finding what you've been looking for, and immediately apply it in real life, but at this time your understanding of Buffett's ideas is not deep, not thorough.  Very often you'll make a lot of mistakes in using them, apply them incorrectly, and apply them blindly, so the results will be patchy.</seg>
<seg id="4"> 2) Stage two: "surpassing" Buffett.  After a period of learning and practice, almost every "intelligent person" is thinking about a few questions: for example, what should a Buffett with Chinese characteristics be like?</seg>
<seg id="5"> Does Buffett's theory need to be applied flexibly in China?</seg>
<seg id="6"> Can I do even better than Buffett?</seg>
<seg id="7"> So the main features of this stage are overconfidence and blind arrogance, looking for a Buffett theory with Chinese characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="8"> After a period of application, the results will generally still be patchy and inconsistent.  If your luck is good, it's better to have some losses and quickly return to the mainstream.</seg>
<seg id="9"> 3) Stage three: you return to Buffett.  After a few wrong turns, you are finally able to realize that +you are an ordinary person, not a genius.</seg>
<seg id="10"> You should demand a little less of yourself.  Making a solid study of Buffett is more than enough.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The simplest turns out to be the most effective.  But the simple methods often include very deep thinking, and you must understand this thinking before you can better apply the simple through to the end.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The characteristics of this stage are results that are not substantial in the short term, but plentiful in the long term, and consistent.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Stage four: "inflexible" Buffett.  Having achieved consistent results, in this stage you are basically inflexible with regard to Buffett's theories.  You take no notice at all of companies other than Buffett's.</seg>
<seg id="14"> You go on learning and deepening your understanding of Buffett and applying it in real life.  The characteristics of this stage are ever-improving results, consistency, and entering into a virtuous spiral.</seg>
<seg id="15"> The time that each person need for each stage varies.  It depends on both your personal situation and your luck.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> He is one of my old net friends.  He posted this story in the group.</seg>
<seg id="3"> I'd rather write this story in this section.</seg>
<seg id="4"> I hope everyone reads this article.  I have no expectation that it will be the so-called top pick, but sometimes there are some things, some truths, that you can understand and learn from a pithy little story.</seg>
<seg id="5"> This is a story that makes you feel very cold when you've finished reading it.</seg>
<seg id="6"> I really hope this really is just a story... because I really do feel bad...</seg>
<seg id="7"> On a highway in the mountain three bandits with guns spotted a pretty woman driver.  They forced the mid-sized bus to stop and tried to take the woman driver off the bus for some fun.  The woman driver desperately cried for help, but all the passengers on the bus were too scared to move.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Just one scrawny middle-aged man responded and went to fight with them, but he was knocked to the ground and suffered injuries.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The man got really angry, vigorously shouting to everyone on the bus to stop the assault, but nobody responded, allowing the woman driver to be dragged into the bushes in the mountain.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Half an hour later, the three bandits returned with the woman driver, whose clothes were disheveled.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The bus was going to start again.  The woman driver told the scrawny man, who had been hurt and was bleeding, to get off the bus.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The man refused, and became argumentative.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Hey, get off the bus!  My bus won't take you.</seg>
<seg id="14"> The middle-aged man became desperate and said: Why are you being so unreasonable?  Was I wrong to try to save you?</seg>
<seg id="15"> You save me?</seg>
<seg id="16"> What did you save me from?</seg>
<seg id="17"> The woman driver flatly dismissed him, and a few passengers sniggered.</seg>
<seg id="18"> The middle-aged man got really angry, and cursed himself for not having the strength of a superhero.</seg>
<seg id="19"> But even if he hadn't succeeded in saving anyone, he didn't deserve to be turned out of the bus like this as a result.  He firmly refused to get off.</seg>
<seg id="20"> For another thing, I've bought a ticket.  I have a right to stay on the bus!</seg>
<seg id="21"> The driver turned away from him and said coldly: If you don't get off the bus, I'm not driving.</seg>
<seg id="22"> Unexpectedly, all of the passengers on the bus who had just ignored the assault seemed to have just woken up and jointly told the man to get off the bus: Quickly, get off the bus.  We've got things to do, we can't wait.</seg>
<seg id="23"> A few strong passengers even wanted to come forward and drag the middle-aged man off the bus.  It was enough to make you think of the story from "Boule de Suif" by Maupassant.</seg>
<seg id="24"> The three bandits were grinning, laughing with satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="25"> One of them, a dark-skinned thug with no principles, said shamelessly: Us guys did everything we wanted with her!</seg>
<seg id="26"> The two other bandits also started talking trash: She's my girlfriend, it's got damn-all to do with you!</seg>
<seg id="27"> There was uproar, until the man's luggage was thrown out of the window of the bus, and then he was shoved out.</seg>
<seg id="28"> The bus once again drove steadily along the mountain road.  The woman driver arranged her hair, and turned on the recorder.</seg>
<seg id="29"> The bus had nearly reached the top of a hill.  When it had gone around this turn it would start going down.  To the left of the bus was the road blasted out of the hillside.  On the right was a cliff hundreds of feet high.</seg>
<seg id="30"> The bus quietly picked up speed.  The woman driver's face was completely composed, her two hands holding the steering wheel tightly, tears glittering in her eyes.</seg>
<seg id="31"> One of the bandits seemed to sense something and said: Slow down, slow down, what the fuck are you trying to do?</seg>
<seg id="32"> The woman driver didn't say anything, and the bus went faster and faster.</seg>
<seg id="33"> The bandit tried to run forward and grab the steering wheel, but the bus sped towards the cliff like an arrow from a bow...</seg>
<seg id="34"> The next day the local newspapers reported: A tragedy occurred yesterday in Fuhu Mountain area.  A mid-sized bus fell off a cliff.</seg>
<seg id="35"> There were no survivors among the driver and 13 passengers.</seg>
<seg id="36"> When the middle-aged man who had been thrown off the bus along the way saw the newspaper, he cried.</seg>
<seg id="37"> No-one knew what he was crying for, or why he cried.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Darkness at the Railroad Station</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Recently I was away from home for a few days.  I took the train, and discovered the nastiness of railway stations everywhere during the summer high season.</seg>
<seg id="3"> I wanted to understand more about what we should be aware of at railroad stations in various places.</seg>
<seg id="4"> I'm from Changsha, so I'll first say a bit about the situation in Changsha.  Everyone should be aware of this when they come to Changsha!</seg>
<seg id="5"> 1. Train tickets are always difficult to buy.  At Changsha railroad station, at every major holiday or the beginning and end of the summer and winter school vacation, you have absolutely no chance of getting a ticket.  However early you go, queuing up is useless.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The best answer I've received when I asked is that the travel agencies book up all the tickets.</seg>
<seg id="7"> But with the ticket touts, you can pay a bit extra and have as many as you want.</seg>
<seg id="8"> 2. Watch out for fake tickets.  The tickets that the touts have are not necessarily real.  Shuangfeng and Xinhua in Hunan make their money, one from fake certificates and one from fake coins, so fake tickets is really just child's play!</seg>
<seg id="9"> Amending tickets is the most basic.  Some tickets look so real that even the train attendants can't tell the difference.</seg>
<seg id="10"> 3. Who touched my money?  When buying things at stores at railroad stations, you absolutely must be careful!</seg>
<seg id="11"> If you want to give them small bills, haha, your bills are always missing a corner, so you have to use a large bill instead.</seg>
<seg id="12"> But when you give a large bill instead, once the store owner has got his hands on it, he will definitely say he can't change it, give it back to you and ask for those small bills with the missing corners again.  At this point all you can do is take back a fake large bill!</seg>
<seg id="13"> 4. Change from a magician.  Not every store owner will swap your big bills.  That's a crime, and the risks are pretty big!</seg>
<seg id="14"> So some "cowardly" store owners have to be magicians.  You clearly see that your change is right when they count it, but when you have a chance to count it yourself, haha!  It's short by a few bills.</seg>
<seg id="15"> 5. Imported drinks everywhere.  There aren't that many cafes at the railroad station, but if you go in one you'll understand.</seg>
<seg id="16"> A few glasses of rough red wine are sold at the price of Martell.  If you don't pay... then even your mother might not recognize you.</seg>
<seg id="17"> 6. Roses and guns.  There are a lot of video booths around the railroad station.  The titles of the films showing are very attractive to us common men, so if you go in and watch, you'll be surely taken to be a distinguished guest who wants a little relaxation.  So a flower girl will come along straight away to keep you company.  Of course, you need to have enough money for a five-star hotel consumption, otherwise those big knives aren't always used for fighting foreign devils!</seg>
<seg id="18"> 7. Ice and fire.  If you've got a Changsha accent or you know Changsha very well, then don't ever think about getting a taxi in the square in front of the railroad station.  The face on the taxi driver will make you understand what a snowstorm in June really is!</seg>
<seg id="19"> But if this is your first time in Changsha, then congratulations!  Never mind that you are going somewhere five minutes' walk away, the driver will still be glad to take you to enjoy the sights of this national-level key tourism city, and will also let you breathe a lungful of secondhand smoke from the famous White Sand brand and have a smell that it is loaded with the local specialty - betel flavoring.</seg>
<seg id="20"> Of course, you have to pay for the transport yourself, don't you?</seg>

<seg id="1"> Nanjing Metro Drivers Should Get Psychotherapy ASAP</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Key word: Psychotherapy</seg>
<seg id="3"> According to a report from Xinhua News Agency, there was a suicide on the tracks in the Nanjing metro on the evening of July 3.</seg>
<seg id="4"> According to what the reporter says, "Zhu Zhengting, 22, is a young metro driver.  He had a nightmarish experience.  When this reporter saw him yesterday, he seemed not to have recovered from his horror.  He was sitting very straight up in his chair, and his eyes also looked a little glazed."</seg>
<seg id="5"> Obviously, this young driver's nerves had received a big shock, and he urgently needed to get some psychotherapy, otherwise it would affect him for the rest of his life.</seg>
<seg id="6"> I don't know if everyone remembers the emergency rescue guy who saved a little girl in an abandoned oil well in the US +state of Texas over a decade ago.  After suffering long-term psychological torture, he eventually chose to kill himself and ended his painful life.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Even though he had had basic psychotherapy at the time, people focused more on the little girl who had been rescued and overlooked precisely the one person who needed psychotherapy more.  In the end, they failed to prevent this tragedy from happening.</seg>
<seg id="8"> In the same way, in the Dover Straits illegal immigration case a few years ago, it was said that the first British policeman to open the container went into shock right there.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Afterwards the British authorities gave him over two months of psychotherapy before he got back to normal.</seg>
<seg id="10"> When people suffer a catastrophic shock, their minds are wounded very seriously.  At this time, if you rely only on your own resources it's very difficult to make a full recovery, and often psychological scars will be left.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Since these scars are very difficult for others to find, and if they do find them, there's nothing they can do, many people involved in incidents will be in pain for the rest of their lives.</seg>
<seg id="12"> However, in our country people don't care enough about psychological wounds, particularly the families or employers of the people involved often think of it only after they've missed the best window for recovery.  Then it's already too late.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Now that there is more diversity in the broadcast media, we often hear about shocking things.  A lot of young women get hurt, and a lot of young children see their own parents suffer terrible injuries.</seg>
<seg id="14"> After these young people have been rescued, we very rarely hear that they have received psychological treatment.  More often they are consoled by the love of their relatives.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Although the victims can feel that they are now safe, the past harm becomes a scar that can never be removed and can be inflamed at any time.  This affects the life of the person involved.</seg>
<seg id="16"> We can be grateful that this driver's superiors quickly calmed him down, and were able to ease his psychological stress.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Ultimately, the driver was not to blame for the accident, and the driver took measures when he discovered the situation.  He had done what he should have done, but just hadn't stopped the tragedy from happening.</seg>
<seg id="18"> I'm sure anyone there would have been shocked by the accident that happened on the scene, even if they weren't the driver involved.</seg>
<seg id="19"> But other people didn't have any connection with the suicide.  Even if they were shocked, they would gradually forget as time went by.</seg>
<seg id="20"> But the driver involved isn't that lucky.  He has to remember, and very likely will remember it all his life.</seg>
<seg id="21"> If he can free himself from this, then he's lucky.  If he can't free himself from it, then he'll often be tortured by this kind of shock.</seg>
<seg id="22"> The modern conception of health is much more comprehensive than in the past.  Psychological health is starting to be noticed by people.</seg>
<seg id="23"> The pity is that the psychological condition of humanity is very depressing.  Particularly in the cities, people's psychological health is not at all what it should be.  Many people have psychological problems to a greater or lesser extent, and some people are not able to get enough attention when they encounter problems.</seg>
<seg id="24"> Think of the lessons of the Yang Lijuan incident a while back.  Some irresponsible news outlets turned a sick person tormented by psychological problems into the subject of media hype, causing very bad impact on our society.</seg>
<seg id="25"> In the future we should avoid this kind of thing happening, otherwise our society really will turn into a sick society.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Key Words: Dongkou No. 5 Middle School, teacher's first period, new syllabus %pw   Five teachers from Dongkou No. 5 Middle School Feel Overwhelmed after the First Period of Training in the New Syllabus  From the morning of July 13 to the 15th, the first group of teachers from Dongkou No. 5 Middle School to take the training for the new syllabus got a real taste of the pressure and the motivation from the new syllabus.</seg>
<seg id="3"> At the same time, they also feel that the syllabus reform is a rare opportunity and challenge for the development of teaching at the school.</seg>
<seg id="4"> On the morning of the 13th, because roadwork on the stretch of road from Shijiang in Dongkou to Longhui had caused a traffic jam, it was already past 1:00 p.m. by the time the teachers from Dongkou No. 5 Middle School and teachers from Suining and other places made it to the municipal education bureau.  The staff at the education bureau, who had long worked beyond their midday break, %pw still got the training materials that they had loaded into cars out of the cars again and did the necessary paperwork for us, and we got our training materials.</seg>
<seg id="5"> At 2.30 p.m., the travel-weary teachers again braved the scorching heat and separately entered the multimedia classrooms at Municipal No. 1 Middle School, Municipal No. 2 Middle School and Municipal No. 6 Middle School to listen to lectures by the relevant experts.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Over the next two days, the teachers listened to lectures by the editors of the teaching materials or listened to lessons learned from the experiences of teachers in provinces which had already started the new syllabus reform.  Some of the educational researchers or teachers who had attended province-level training in the new syllabus also talked about their experiences and what they had learned.</seg>
<seg id="7"> On the morning of the 15th, after finishing all of the training courses, we then went through assessment.  The five teachers from Dongkou No. 5 Middle School had studied hard and never came in late or left earlier, so they passed the assessment easily, and all received a certificate of course completion.</seg>
<seg id="8"> During the training period, the Dongkou No. 5 Middle School teachers talked among themselves.  At first we all felt that the new syllabus was rather unfamiliar, that this was a difficult task, that there was a lot of pressure, and that it was difficult to understand.</seg>
<seg id="9"> But after the training was finished, everyone thought that this was also an opportunity and a challenge.</seg>
<seg id="10"> We are all determined to work at adjusting the structure of our knowledge and complete the task of syllabus reform as satisfactorily as possible.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The second group of teachers to attend the new syllabus training arrived at the relevant location for training on the 16th.</seg>

<seg id="3"> Dongkou No. 5 Middle School Holds Meeting on New Syllabus Training, Makes Arrangements for Going to the Municipal Education Bureau to Attend Syllabus Reform Training  At 12:00 noon on July 5, the school held a meeting in the principal's office for the teachers attending training in the new syllabus during the summer vacation.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Happy to Make Friends with Fans of Celebrities</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Key Words: fans of celebrities</seg>
<seg id="3"> I have a female friend whom I've never seen.</seg>
<seg id="4"> I said straight out to her, I really admire you!</seg>
<seg id="5"> Because you express your love candidly.</seg>
<seg id="6"> She likes a male host of a popular entertainment program in Taiwan, and has never hidden her feelings.</seg>
<seg id="7"> When this male host hosts a program in Jinan, she flies to Jinan; when this male host goes to Changsha to do a guest appearance, she flies to Changsha.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The male host says in his book that a friend gave him a slingshot with no shot.  Pleasantly surprised, she told me, "I gave him that slingshot."</seg>
<seg id="9"> She also helps to do an online magazine about this star.  Every issue she excitedly reads it with me.</seg>
<seg id="10"> I've always really liked talking with some people who frankly admit that they are a fan of such-and-such a celebrity.</seg>
<seg id="11"> These celebrities can be movie stars, can be sports stars, and of course can also be great figures.</seg>
<seg id="12"> I've never thought that these friends are shallow.  I think they're very lovely.</seg>
<seg id="13"> These people are usually straightforward people.  If they like someone, they like someone, if they don't like someone, they don't like them.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Getting along with this kind of people can be very easy.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Although they won't think 100% about your feelings, you at least know what makes them tick.  You also know that you will feel more secure if you spend time with them.</seg>
<seg id="16"> These people are also very honest.</seg>
<seg id="17"> You should know that it also takes courage to dare to express your likings.</seg>
<seg id="18"> It's precisely because of this that a lot of people just secretly like a person their entire life, or they might even look down a little on those people who barefacedly say they are a fan of so-and-so.</seg>
<seg id="19"> I think honesty is a person's greatest strong point, being honest with friends and being honest with yourself.</seg>
<seg id="20"> But it is actually very hard to do that.</seg>
<seg id="21"> If one can love a celebrity, it also proves that a part of his heart is selfless.</seg>
<seg id="22"> Some of my friends are fans of celebrities.</seg>
<seg id="23"> Sometimes they can go through a lot of hardship to get a look at this celebrity.  They can sacrifice many things, tighten their belts and scrimp and save, holding a placard in their left hand and pressing a camera button with their right, while shouting on and on.</seg>
<seg id="24"> You could say they are very silly or childish, but it takes selflessness to love someone without looking for anything in return.</seg>
<seg id="25"> Because in reality, there are far too many who love themselves, think they're great, and think little of other people.  So this bit of selflessness seems to be quite precious.</seg>
<seg id="26"> So when everyone starts chatting and saying that the celebrity they like is so-and-so, if someone says, I've never made anyone my idol...</seg>
<seg id="27"> Haha, then you should watch out.</seg>

<seg id="4"> Thinking back, it was when she was promoting "Color Blossoms."</seg>
<seg id="5"> The time when I saw "Colour Blossoms" was the days when I was mad about erotic movies.</seg>
<seg id="6"> At the time I thought it was extraordinary that sex movies could be filmed in such an esthetic way.  Sometimes they were also really interesting and were called erotic movies.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Actually, I haven't seen many erotic movies, but they cover quite a lot of countries.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The first ones I saw were from Korea and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Later I also saw quite a lot from third world countries and some from Latin America and Europe.  But I didn't see many Hollywood or French movies.</seg>
<seg id="10"> I couldn't bear to delete two of them from my computer.  One is "Plum Blossom," and the other is just "Color Blossoms."</seg>
<seg id="11"> The first half of "Color Blossoms" is quite good.  They are all first-timers and act very energetically.  The direction is also very measured.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Then in the second half it's a bit perverted, I can't take it at all.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Actually, what I want to say is that Teresa Cheung said on the program that her boyfriends have included those of almost every nationality in the world, except for Africans.</seg>
<seg id="14"> At present, she has four boyfriends.</seg>
<seg id="15"> On this issue, I'm afraid the average person would find it unacceptable and would say this person is a slut.</seg>
<seg id="16"> But the key point in this issue is that she was very honest when she was talking about these issues.  There wasn't a hint of an expression that would make people uncomfortable.</seg>
<seg id="17"> She also talked about her view of love.</seg>
<seg id="18"> For example, both parties should keep their money separate.</seg>
<seg id="19"> I guess their identities should also be independent.  Each one controls their own fate.</seg>
<seg id="20"> Because I know that for people who are in love, love is alive, is selfish.  How could it allow the person you love to accept the love of another person at the same time?</seg>
<seg id="21"> Going by my experience and guesswork, most likely Teresa Cheung's love is no longer a simple entanglement.  She must be going for the classic relationship with a younger man.</seg>
<seg id="22"> In a relationship with a younger man, the older woman can accommodate anything, including having several toyboys at the same time.  At the same time, the younger man can attach himself without reservation to the older woman because of her attractiveness and maternal nature, but maybe doesn't mind whether he is the only one, etc., etc.</seg>
<seg id="23"> But I also felt from what Teresa Cheung said that she is someone who really knows how to enjoy life.</seg>
<seg id="24"> For example, she is +crazily passionate about travel.</seg>
<seg id="25"> So I also have reason to believe that her life is also very exciting.</seg>
<seg id="26"> If it was the past me, I'm afraid I would still not be able to accept this kind of thing.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Just like now, I've come to accept a lot of people.  Actually, this hasn't got that much to do with tolerance or intolerance, it's just about thinking it over in your own mind, then there are no absolute loves or hates.</seg>
<seg id="28"> These people, like passer-by A, friend B, Zhang Ziyi, good friend C, and Sister Lotus.</seg>
<seg id="29"> Looking at other people's lives, I am an onlooker, so to other people, mustn't I also be the main character in my own life?</seg>
<seg id="30"> It's just like, even though I'm not in Jianghu, there are always stories about me in Jianghu.</seg>

<seg id="1"> People Always Need a Spice of Entertainment</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Key words: spice of entertainment</seg>
<seg id="3"> For people, life is a tiring thing, so it's best if we have a spice of entertainment.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Either laughing at ourselves or watching jokes from the people around us, gossiping about other people.</seg>
<seg id="5"> For example, just going to the Tianya "Celebrity Gossip" board for a bit of relaxation.</seg>
<seg id="6"> In there, everyone says whatever they want, but you should of course have a bit of ability to distinguish between right and wrong, because there's all kinds of "trickery."</seg>
<seg id="7"> The results of "say what you want" are that you don't even know what you're saying yourself, but you want to be clear what it is you're reading.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Little S calls Tsai Kang-yung a "scholar."</seg>
<seg id="9"> If I also count as one, then it's the kind who has read some books, but hasn't yet really grasped them.</seg>
<seg id="10"> At least I always know my own shortcomings.</seg>
<seg id="11"> But, the +good thing is that I got a few things that I myself wanted to get when I did this bit of reading.</seg>
<seg id="12"> It also happens that I like just pondering over things, too.  So I was pondering and reading at the same time, but I got quite a few ideas clear.  A lot of things clicked into place.</seg>
<seg id="13"> So, gradually I got into some habits, like telling myself to be a bit harder on myself and a bit better to other people.</seg>
<seg id="14"> When running into a problem with some matter, first look for the cause in yourself.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Use your head in the way you do things and follow your heart in dealing with relationships.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Keep a low profile and do things in a low key.</seg>
<seg id="17"> But, you know, not all people are that nice.  They'll always be selfish, and always think about their own gains and losses.  There'll always be times when they should be using their heads, but they follow their hearts into a big mess, and times when they should be following their hearts, but they're still using f**king logic like there's no tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id="18"> But at least there is a good side: I never regret the choices I've made.</seg>
<seg id="19"> If I've done it then I've done it; if I've messed up, then I live with it.</seg>
<seg id="20"> What's the point in thinking about all that useless stuff?</seg>
<seg id="21"> At least I'm not one of those people who likes to be all po-faced and puff myself up as a scholar.  I'm just an ordinary person, too.</seg>
<seg id="22"> Where I'm different from other people is just that I don't have to be cynical.  I'm a bit more reasonable in dealing with matters in general.</seg>
<seg id="23"> Or, for example, my trust is particularly strong.</seg>
<seg id="24"> Once I trust someone, then I'll think that everything about him is good.</seg>
<seg id="25"> Even if there are shortcomings, I'm still perfectly happy to forgive them.</seg>
<seg id="26"> Even though I'm not the type of person to call people friends readily, I'm the kind who thinks about his friends and puts himself in their shoes.</seg>
<seg id="27"> But I'm also therefore pretty strict in choosing my friends.</seg>
<seg id="28"> I also don't understand at all why there are still so many people today who trust so much everything the newspapers say.</seg>
<seg id="29"> Or is it that in their minds, today's reports are still sacred like those of the past?</seg>
<seg id="30"> But then, in this world, there are still a lot of things that I don't understand.</seg>
<seg id="31"> Jokes.</seg>
<seg id="32"> Giving myself a slap on the face.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Song Dandan's "The Secrets of Happiness," Warm and Moving</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Key words: Song Dandan, The Secrets of Happiness</seg>
<seg id="3"> A while ago, I read in the newspaper that Song Dandan had published a new book called "The Secrets of Happiness."</seg>
<seg id="4"> I really wanted to read it.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Because I thought that as a woman of this age, with this kind of profession, she had experienced changes in her family and in her career.  Having gone through these, what are her views on herself and on life?</seg>
<seg id="6"> As expected, I was not disappointed.  After I read it, I had two feelings.  First, I got an electric shock: looking at someone else's life, you can see the image of your own life just the same.  Second, I was also very much moved.  It was full of things like the details of her love for her family.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Why did I get an electric shock?</seg>
<seg id="8"> In the book, Song Dandan writes, "I missed an important principle in life: One is happier to give than to receive.</seg>
<seg id="9"> I was always busy giving, busy making myself happy.</seg>
<seg id="10"> I never received, and never understood how to.  I neglected to allow other people to give, which is to say, I neglected other people's right to make themselves happy."</seg>
<seg id="11"> I find that I've also been always enjoying this kind of happiness.  In the future perhaps I should be a bit more careful.</seg>
<seg id="12"> It requires a certain amount of courage for a person to look steadily on their own past, and lay it all out in front of everyone.</seg>
<seg id="13"> In here she includes her first love, her failed marriage with Ying Da and her deep dissection of herself and her love for her son.</seg>
<seg id="14"> This book has another praiseworthy aspect, because at first the publisher must have given her a lot of pressure to focus more on cases like "I Love My Family," "House of the Flying Daggers" and the series of sketches with Zhao Benshan.</seg>
<seg id="15"> But she probably stood her ground.  She only mentions Zhao Benshan a bit at the end, and as for "House of the Flying Daggers" and "I Love My Family," she hardly mentions them.</seg>
<seg id="16"> The whole book is full of the warm and moving reflections of a 40-year-old woman on life, on love, on family, and on love for the family.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Busy Vacation</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Key words: vacation, busy</seg>
<seg id="3"> I've been on vacation for nearly a week, but I haven't had any time at all to relax.</seg>
<seg id="4"> I went to the college for a meeting, and I have to prepare the materials for going on a trip next week for a conference, and a speech for the conference.</seg>
<seg id="5"> This vacation will be very busy.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Barring accidents, according to my schedule I have three conferences to attend and four or five cities to go to.</seg>
<seg id="7"> My life has suddenly been filled up with many things: the same things, different things.  I've almost forgotten how I used to spend the vacations before.</seg>
<seg id="8"> It seems that in my memory, I still didn't have much relaxation time.</seg>
<seg id="9"> It's just that before I still had long periods of time that I could arrange myself, but this year it seems like there's less time.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Is this a good thing?  Or a bad thing?</seg>
<seg id="11"> Being busy, you feel a bit more substantial, but if there's no results or no gains for your busy work, then there is much less point to being busy.</seg>
<seg id="12"> But sometimes it seems that life can't be completely measured in terms of results.  Life is to be gradually experienced.  Solidity and stability, substance and pleasure are also a kind of gains, even though sometimes this gain can't be measured using society's appraisal standards.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Every person needs confirmation from society's values and their own values.  If we can't get both, what do we do?</seg>
<seg id="14"> Marxism teaches us that we should take the values of society as primary, and proposes that individuals should contribute to society.  But in reality, a healthy, wholesome society should also fully respect an individual's wishes and value choices, and should create the conditions in which personal values can be realized.</seg>
<seg id="15"> As all this occurred to my mind all of a sudden, I'm discovering more and more that Marxist principles really are very effective.</seg>
<seg id="16"> The truth really is like this, but when it actually comes to real life, people often find they are still bound to feel confused.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Even if the realization of personal values doesn't interfere with society's values, will each one of us practical individuals be content with the realization of our own real values so much that we ignore the judgment of society?</seg>
<seg id="18"> Or can the satisfaction with our own values be separated from the judgment of society?</seg>
<seg id="19"> I'd say it's very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="20"> So each of us is bound to pursue the extraordinary and beyond, even as we are working to be a good ordinary person.  And if we waste our lives, we also will always blame ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="21"> This could be said to be one side of socialized man.</seg>
<seg id="22"> Being on vacation I still feel more or less a bit relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="23"> At least, I have time to watch some DVDs, and I can relax myself and have fun for a while.</seg>
<seg id="24"> I can say what I want, but I still have to work, and life goes on just the same.</seg>
<seg id="25"> Next week I have to go to Xi'an again for a conference.</seg>
<seg id="26"> It's a city that I've never been to, but that I don't seem to much like, because of some "prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="27"> I hope that this trip can change my impression of the city, haha.</seg>

<seg id="1"> "Having a Very Feminist Life"</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Key words: men, feminism, era</seg>
<seg id="3"> This afternoon, Ying called me.  We chatted for a while, and then my watching "Happy Boys" came up.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Ying said: "No way!  You are too cute.  You finish watching Supergirls and then watch Happy Boys.  You're just a dedicated viewer of Hunan Satellite TV."</seg>
<seg id="5"> I said that was true.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Ying said she had seen some of the selection programs for the boys, and thought they were all girly boys.  I also thought the same, but I told her that the top four contestants had been selected from the five on Happy Boys.  Next week three will be selected from the four.  They were singing really well, each of them was excellent.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Ying, who studies popular culture and consumer culture, also said excitedly that she would have a look too next week.  After all, we had got to the most critical stage of the competition, and it would definitely be worth watching.  And taking an interest in this would also be good for stocking up on some examples for future research.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Then we started talking again about how this is an era of male beauty.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Men have finally turned from "spectators" into "the spectated," whereas, women, who had previously been the object, have become the subject.  They can appreciate and face various male talent shows in this era of male beauty from the perspective of the observer.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Ying said this was women's liberation, a sign of feminism.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Then next she said, "Don't you think you are now having a very feminist life?"</seg>
<seg id="12"> When I heard what Ying said, I was so amused that I laughed out loud.</seg>
<seg id="13"> This remark itself is filled with the meaning of feminism, it's just that I don't have a good  capacity for analysis like Ying's that can explain all these things more deeply and clearly.</seg>
<seg id="14"> I like Chen Chusheng's singing on Happy Boys very much.  It's got a very special texture, a power to pierce space and time right to your heart; it's very pure and very comforting.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Su Xing sings in many different styles, and is full of feeling.  He looks handsome and cultured, but he gives you a lively, relaxed feeling.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Zhang Jie sings with great clarity and power, and particularly the two songs he nailed today, "The Way You Look" and "Past Goes with the Wind," are both old songs that I like very much, they left a deep impression.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Wei Chen has a cute, innocent face that extremely resembles Lu Yi's.  It's said that he attracts a lot of girls, and of course his voice isn't bad.</seg>
<seg id="18"> The next clash between these four strong competitors should be very good to watch.</seg>
<seg id="19"> I'm looking forward to watching their great performances next week.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Random Thoughts on Kimchi, June 29</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Key words: kimchi, Seoul</seg>
<seg id="3"> Random Thoughts on Kimchi, June 29  I switched on international roaming, but when I got off the plane, my cell phone seemed to have had its power cut.  It still didn't have even one bar of signal.  Maybe GSM's effective coverage means the scope of the "heart," and it will be effective from the next billing date.</seg>
<seg id="4"> These few days, I'm going to lose contact with everyone temporarily.  Haha, will there be anyone who worries about me because of this?</seg>
<seg id="5"> I've turned on their Secretary System, just want to be sure who's missing me.</seg>
<seg id="6"> It doesn't matter if it's business or personal.</seg>
<seg id="7"> But the question is, who am I hoping will miss me?</seg>
<seg id="8"> My heart has turned completely blank again.  I don't know when it started.</seg>
<seg id="9"> I don't understand why there are always some people that you want to keep hold of but can't, and some people that you don't want to keep hold of but who always think that they can squeeze themselves in.  Is it like when you're talking about markets?</seg>
<seg id="10"> But can I always let the "white gloves" block up my heart, no matter whether or not there is a place for you?</seg>
<seg id="11"> But substance and heart cannot be talked about as if they were the same after all!</seg>
<seg id="12"> Our car is driving along the expressway to Busan.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Our department head is driving silently, and I don't have anything to say.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Anyway, he doesn't understand Chinese and doesn't understand English, either, and me, I can only speak a very few very awkward sentences of English.</seg>
<seg id="15"> I'm looking at the computer, rather bored, punching the keyboard.  In the car, apart from the sound of the keyboard, there's only the pleasant voice of a Korean girl giving directions on the GPRS.  Everything is too -- rather silent.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Outside the window, all that's left to see is never-ending green and a grey-blue sky.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Silence is unusual for my personality.</seg>
<seg id="18"> What I hadn't expected is that the only thing in this country that gives me a sense of fellow feeling is actually English.</seg>
<seg id="19"> Apart from making me dizzy like from radiation, those little circles I see everywhere have no other function at all.</seg>
<seg id="20"> I think South Korea definitely will not produce compasses.</seg>
<seg id="21"> Because there's no demand in the market.</seg>
<seg id="22"> Seoul is very clean, thoroughly clean, unfailingly clean.</seg>
<seg id="23"> It's just a pity that in the few days I am in Seoul, I won't have time to go anywhere but my workplace and the department store.  My entire impression is limited to what I see along the streets.</seg>
<seg id="24"> Luckily, everything was still very good!</seg>
<seg id="25"> Koreans are polite in a traditional way.  They smile meticulously, listen carefully.  They're elegant and quiet.</seg>
<seg id="26"> Everything I've been able to notice is the beautiful surface: traditional customs, ancient architectural styles, and absolutely scrupulous courtesy.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Is this hypocritical?</seg>
<seg id="28"> Then it's better to be a bit hypocritical, at least everyone is polite!</seg>
<seg id="29"> If you don't see the ugly things, maybe you'll think they don't exist.</seg>
<seg id="30"> Korean cuisine is really amazing!</seg>
<seg id="31"> It's just that I don't like it.  I don't understand why they suffer themselves going back and forth, when it's only kimchi in various forms and on an assortment platter.  Of course, there must be seaweed.</seg>
<seg id="32"> Then, thinking again about it, the amount that Korean people know about their cuisine is still very awesome.  They can tell the difference between kimchi that's been pickled above ground and underground or for different lengths of time, and with up to minute precision.</seg>
<seg id="33"> This shows, from one perspective, that the seriousness of Koreans might have something to do with the kimchi served from morning till night.</seg>
<seg id="34"> My only headache is that I don't know what kind of recipe with kimchi again somehow integrated will it have at the Japanese tofu restaurant that the head of department is going to take us to.</seg>
<seg id="35"> Thinking of the Chinese food last night, I feel like I want to cry.  It was completely Koreanized.  The only thing I could eat turned out to be kimchi.</seg>
<seg id="36"> A-ha, thanks to China Southern Airlines Co. and the kimchi it offers together with its in-flight meals.</seg>
<seg id="37"> The airline must think that I want to start getting used to it from the moment I get on the plane.</seg>
<seg id="38"> Two more days before I will go back to my country.  If there still isn't anyone to miss, then I can still miss a meal of Auntie's braised pork!</seg>
<seg id="39"> After all, satisfaction for the stomach comes a bit more directly than for the heart.</seg>
<seg id="40"> Of course, it has nothing at all to do with kimchi.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Two Trees</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Two trees: one is me, one was my brother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="3"> We gave each other shade, and looked after each other.</seg>
<seg id="4"> In my generation they all have a lot of children, but I only have sisters, no brothers.  So the presence of my brother-in-law seemed extremely important.</seg>
<seg id="5"> We both come from poor backgrounds.  We had to take part in doing a lot of domestic chores when we were very small.  Even though I always worked hard to act like a man and wanted to do my work like an expert, I never ever got my father's' approval.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Ever since I was small, I've suffered from sleepwalking, but it wasn't too serious.  But when I was doing work around the house, it's hard to stop my mind wandering.</seg>
<seg id="7"> For example, my father told me to put some plaster on the chimney at our old house.  I nimbly climbed up onto the roof to do it.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The chimney got plastered OK, but when it rained, water leaked into the room.  The reason was that I had trodden on and broken the roof tiles.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Another example, my father told me to change a light bulb, one of those old-fashioned incandescent bulbs.</seg>
<seg id="10"> When I'd climbed onto the stool, the light bulb in my hand slipped from my hand, fell onto the concrete and smashed.</seg>
<seg id="11"> I've got countless examples like this, so when my brother-in-law came to live with us, he naturally took over these various little jobs, and did them really beautifully and with no need to pay any labor cost.</seg>
<seg id="12"> And I gleefully hid in a corner reading light novels thick as bricks.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Later we grew up into two trees, two trees big enough to support the home of a family.</seg>
<seg id="14"> And my father could not stop himself shrinking.  Sitting in a wheelchair, he became a quiet bush in the leafy shade.</seg>
<seg id="15"> No-one expected that things suddenly changed: at 50, my brother-in-law suddenly contracted a serious illness.  That great tree, so vital and bushy on the surface, came so close to that terrifying death in a way that was hard to believe.</seg>
<seg id="16"> On that summer's day, the sunlight bright enough to knock you out, the doctor outside the operating room at Peking Union Medical College Hospital said casually: it's not worth operating.</seg>
<seg id="17"> He can survive another two months at the most.</seg>
<seg id="18"> At that moment it was like I'd been hit by a stray bullet.  My spirit left my body for an instant, and I stood there blankly like an idiot.</seg>
<seg id="19"> I started sleepwalking again.  I saw the old courtyard in our home, and the shadow of my young brother-in-law busy in the courtyard.</seg>
<seg id="20"> It was the shrill sound of my elder sister's crying that woke me up.  I hastily ran to hug my sister, who slumped into sitting on the floor of the hospital corridor, and as we hugged the tears were streaming down our faces.</seg>
<seg id="21"> The bright sunshine suddenly disappeared, and wave after wave of blackness appeared in front of me.</seg>
<seg id="22"> After we came back from Beijing to our city here, my brother-in-law very quickly found out what his condition was.  After he and my sister cried together for a while, his mood lightened instead.</seg>
<seg id="23"> My brother-in-law started to methodically arrange for what would happen after his death.  For example, he told his son: look after your grandmother for me.  When the old lady dies, she wants to be buried in the same grave as your grandfather; and how to open the grave when the remains are put together.</seg>
<seg id="24"> Go and see your maternal grandfather often, and buy him some useful things when it's the New Year or holidays.</seg>
<seg id="25"> For example, he told my younger sister: when I'm gone, you should often come and see your sister, she is sure to be extremely lonely on her own.</seg>
<seg id="26"> I took as much time as I could to go and see him, but when he saw me his expression was one of shame.</seg>
<seg id="27"> We often had nothing to say, just as two plants that have life but have no ability to converse.</seg>
<seg id="28"> These are two adult trees.  Experience of wind and rain has made us able to face hardship calmly.  Do you need to pass anything more on to me?</seg>
<seg id="29"> It seemed there was no need.</seg>
<seg id="30"> Because in your heart you know: after you've gone, my sister, the children you and my sister had, and this big family can only rely on the tree that is me to support them alone.</seg>
<seg id="31"> No-one forced me to be a man.</seg>
<seg id="32"> Being a man, whether you want to or not, you must brace your back without hesitation and take up the burden.</seg>
<seg id="33"> The only pity is: why did your tree have to wither so very early?  You should have had a full and flourishing old age.</seg>
<seg id="34"> The day you went was the first day of the new year.</seg>
<seg id="35"> Just at the time when all the Chinese people in the world were rejoicing and welcoming the new spring, you left, alone.</seg>
<seg id="36"> Perhaps in another space and time, another living baby sprout has just been born?</seg>

<seg id="1"> X Minutes of My Life</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The reason for such a trendy-looking title is that at that moment of extreme desperation, my racing brain had no chance to take note of the time.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Like an innocent person who receives a death penalty judgment out of the blue - would he still calmly and leisurely pick over the grammatical errors in the "Verdict?"</seg>
<seg id="4"> It was a winter's day, and it was very cold in the youth center.</seg>
<seg id="5"> And I don't know whose duty day it was, but the heater hadn't been fired up for a day.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Because there was word of a strong earthquake, when we went home in the evening, we were also reluctant to restart the fire.</seg>
<seg id="7"> On the long plank-bed that could sleep 12 people, we four wrapped ourselves in cotton-padded quilts and while shivering, played a poker game of "three-on-one" under the dim lamplight to win food coupons.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Suddenly a noise thundered towards us from afar.  We few looked at one another for just an instant, then immediately realized that a disaster had struck.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Then we threw down the cards in our hands, flew down to the floor and through the two narrow doorways, scrambled to get out.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Just at the moment that we ran out of the dormitory, the poor thatched dwelling built with stones disintegrated in an instant.</seg>
<seg id="11"> We had rushed out into the yard, and it was like we were standing on a pitching and rolling boat.  We fell back and forth Like Weebles and couldn't anchor ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Within a few seconds, all of the buildings around us, +unlike the sedate images of days past, let out a strange "jiaah" noise one after another as they danced a half-crazed break dance before collapsing on themselves in a puff of smoke and dust.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The power cables above our heads naturally couldn't bear being the odd ones out, and snapped "crack crack," then fled like whips in all directions.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Meanwhile, in front of us and behind us, the rampaging quake demon was setting off ceremonial fireworks to celebrate his own creation.  The spectacular earthquake lights could rival the stage effects in any major war movie, and the rumbling sound of the earth was like war drums urging on the fighting.  They tortured every weakened nerve.</seg>
<seg id="15"> At that time we only had one idea: the human race's last day had come!</seg>
<seg id="16"> I could imagine it: the earth under our feet would open up with a crash, and boiling lava like molten steel would issue its flaming invitation, and humans, like bugs, would be cast in free-fall into the lava one after another.  Too stingy to give off a whiff of blue smoke, they would vanish in an instant.</seg>
<seg id="17"> My spine felt comfortably numb, as though it had been injected with freezing water.  In the ashy darkness the faces of my companions floated unsteadily like paper masks.</seg>
<seg id="18"> I was thinking: is this how humanity bids farewell to this wonderful world?  Will tens of thousands of years of civilization vanish without a trace now?</seg>
<seg id="19"> But I wasn't yet 20 years old!  The blossom of my youth had only just started to bloom, and I had only just perceived the joy of existence.  I was so unwilling to leave beautiful life!</seg>
<seg id="20"> And my parents, my family?  Where are you?  What are you now doing?  Are you still living in this world?</seg>
<seg id="21"> At the moment when I faced the savage grinning face of death, I missed you so much!</seg>
<seg id="22"> ...In my confusion, I don't know how long it was before I finally realized with joy that the sound of the earthquake was getting quieter little by little, the shaking of the earth was slowing little by little, and the fireworks were also no longer sparkling above my head.</seg>
<seg id="23"> A tanker, tossing on stormy seas, finally slowly sailed into a calm harbor.</seg>
<seg id="24"> A young and easily breakable heart was carefully returned to its original state after going through a manic ransacking.</seg>
<seg id="25"> Oh, Earth, my home, you've finally allowed us to feel again a home's warmth and closeness!</seg>
<seg id="26"> A feeling of survivor's luck ran slowly like warm water from beneath my feet through my whole body.</seg>
<seg id="27"> When Yu Doudou, who had just turned 17, could stand steadily, she faced the yard of the youth center that had once been calm and warm, but now was all broken-down ruins, and suddenly started sobbing loudly.</seg>
<seg id="28"> Everyone was infected, and hot tears flowed everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="29"> Snow started to fall from the sky.  Was it a lament floating down for the misfortunes of humanity?</seg>
<seg id="30"> That year, the Haicheng earthquake claimed the lives of as many as 1,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="31"> An expert said: It's lucky the forecasts came in time, and that it happened before people had gone to bed, otherwise the strong earthquake, measuring 7.3, would have claimed the lives of at least 100,000 people!</seg>
<seg id="32"> Only a year later, the Tangshan earthquake erupted, and more than 200,000 people died.</seg>

<seg id="1"> The Things That Go on in the Village</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> There are many households in the village.  Of them all, the members of a family called South are the most disliked.  In the village there's a common saying that goes: guard against fire, guard against robbery, and guard against the Souths.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Actually, the South family are pretty honest.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Some people steal a melon or something from someone else's land at any time.  And the South family are just committing some petty theft at the worst and do not deserve to be isolated by the whole village.</seg>
<seg id="5"> No-one has clean hands, so who have we Souths offended?</seg>
<seg id="6"> The Souths started to organize some very worthy activities, showing that this village was first established by the ancestors of the South family, that the Souths had always been a major rice-growing family, and that they had produced quite a number of famous people in history.  In addition, they had made a great contribution to improving the village.</seg>
<seg id="7"> At that same time, the Souths warmly invited the village cadres to their home to have a look and sit for a while.</seg>
<seg id="8"> In all, the South family are very aspiring and proactive, striving to be powerful.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Not long ago, the West family did something very disgraceful.  They damaged the Souths' young crops very badly.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The family called West are known throughout the village for matchmaking.  All of the young guys in the village have something to thank the Wests for.</seg>
<seg id="11"> If it weren't for the good matchmaking of the Wests, how would each of you families and households be able to take good care of production?</seg>
<seg id="12"> But this time, the Wests bashed down the Souths' young crops with illegal bricks in a place called Hongdong.  It was truly terrible, and the whole village was furious.  They all said that there are no good people in the West family.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The Souths demanded an explanation from the Wests, attracting the sympathy of everyone in the village.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Everyone in the village poured abuse on the Wests.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Thus, the battlefield shifted to the West's house.</seg>
<seg id="16"> The Souths were determined to project a good image before the 17th village meeting, to make the South family, which is most populous and thriving, developed.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Even though the cadres in the village urge everyone to get along harmoniously with one another every day, this village named China is never peaceful.</seg>
<seg id="18"> The most annoying thing is, in just three short months, even the pigs have started oinking crazily and stirring up trouble.  They want to raise their price!</seg>
<seg id="19"> Two years ago, the chickens in every village were squawking about catching a cold.  Didn't they all get killed?</seg>
<seg id="20"> Pigs, why don't you think?</seg>
<seg id="21"> If you talk about calling for a revolution again, you'll have no way of avoiding the chop!</seg>
<seg id="22"> Meanwhile, the America Village and Britain Village that are used to bullying people don't seem peaceable either even though they are wealthy.</seg>
<seg id="23"> There are a few vagabonds who knocked down the tall building in America Village today and will throw some exploding pots in the metro in Britain Village tomorrow.  It's enough to make anyone frightened, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="24"> Because of this, most people in China Village think that even though it is terrible not to be able to afford a place to stay, not to be able to afford to go to the doctor and not to be able to afford to go to school, if they can peacefully farm some land, do some jobs, make a few connections, then they have already entered a new era.</seg>
<seg id="25"> The Souths, the Wests - what family hasn't got skeletons in its cupboard?</seg>
<seg id="26"> Just take the Wan family, who live in a little +bay to the southeast of the village.  Even though the head of that household is a bit shameless, isn't our great China Village willing to take this family in all the same?</seg>
<seg id="27"> Looking to the 2008 Inter-Village Sports Contest that will be held in our China Village, let's have less of the bad things that have happened in the village, and let's deal with the bad kids in the village.</seg>
<seg id="28"> Every family, every household, light the lamps and stoke the fires.  If you have money, give money; if you can work, then work.</seg>
<seg id="29"> When the time comes, everyone goes to the village common to see a golden egg laid in the bird's nest!</seg>
<seg id="30"> (Offscreen, fading out: A golden egg or a silver egg?  To all our viewers, to all our viewers, I'm your host on Village TV, Brother Yong...)</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Key words: Eric, Google, Google, China  Poster: an ordinary Google (Google) employee</seg>
<seg id="3"> I'm an employee who joined Google China relatively early.  In the last two years, we've gone through a lot of challenges.  Some we had predicted when they arrived; others really were beyond what we had imagined at the time.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Yesterday, I heard that in this quarter's financial report the company had a section talking specially about China's development, and I happened to hear Eric reply to a question about China.  This gave me a lot to think about, so I'm translating it as encouragement for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="5"> This remark was made by Google (Google) CEO Eric when he was replying to a question by a reporter during the Google Inc. Second Quarter 2007 Earnings Conference Call (Google Second Quarter 2007 Earnings Conference Call) (http://investor.google.com/earnings.html), saying that he is absolutely satisfied with the results that Google China has achieved so far, and that he is full of confidence about Google's prospects for development in the Chinese market.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Eric says that in China we have top-quality people, ever-improving facilities, and constantly enriched localized product lines.</seg>
<seg id="7"> He thinks that even though Google's success is not yet necessarily visible, as far as Google China is concerned, it's been an excellent beginning, and that with hard work from the China team, support from headquarters, and a dauntless spirit, he firmly believes that in the future Google will achieve astonishing success in China.</seg>
<seg id="8"> That's true.  What's important is that we keep forging onwards and upwards.  Because we grew up here, we have deep feelings for this place, and we deeply believe that Google should give China more, more; that it should give its users more, more.</seg>

<seg id="2"> It's the fashion to do everything top-less now, especially in summer.  Everyone is itching to just go running naked, because any clothing will make you feel hotter.</seg>
<seg id="3"> You maybe already knew that T-backs, which have been fashionable for many years, have been defeated by G-strings, because the latter doesn't have any straps at all.</seg>
<seg id="4"> So in an age like this, the flip-flops you're wearing on your feet may now be behind the times, because now an all-new kind of strapless flip-flop has appeared.  It's only got a sole.</seg>
<seg id="5"> How do you wear it if it's got no straps?</seg>
<seg id="6"> We're not gods, and the manufacturer can't do magic.</seg>
<seg id="7"> This flip-flop... sticks directly to the sole of your foot.  This is no spoof product, this is a real item in the shops.  The price is about 13.5 US dollars a pair.</seg>
<seg id="8"> This is another "I've imagined it existing, but never imagined that it really did exist" product.  It leaves me dumbfounded.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The manufacturer thinks this kind of flip-flop is amazingly cool.  Don't believe me?</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Key words: Cell phone</seg>
<seg id="3"> Korean company Iljin Display has brought out a laser projector module no bigger than a coin.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Because the module is so small in size, this kind of projector module could even be installed in a cell phone.  On a wall, you can see a projection seven inches in size.</seg>
<seg id="5"> (via) Traditional projectors include three different LCD screens, each responsible for outputting a different video signal: red, green and blue.  But this mini-projector can switch among the three colors by using only a single LCD screen.  This way it has cut the size and production costs of the projector.</seg>
<seg id="6"> An official statement says that the LCD screen in this projector is only 0.24 inches in size, and could very easily be integrated into a cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Currently more than half of the cell phones on the market include a camera, and it is estimated that cell phones with internal projectors will soon appear on the market.  But whether the market will embrace them is really very difficult to say.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, I Worry about the Result of Your "Limited Time Combat against Corruption"</seg>
</hl>

<seg id="2"> [Guchanhuo] posted on 2007-07-12 14:41:10 [send text messages] [table view]</seg>
<seg id="3"> The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection gave people guilty of corruption across the country a one-month deadline from May 30, that is until June 30, to confess on their own initiative. If they do not do so within the time limit, then they will be arrested.</seg>
<seg id="4"> I, a common folk, could not help laughing when I learned about this. A month before the police arrest the thief, they told him to confess immediately on his own initiative, or else they will arrest him. Where on earth does such anti-corruption work exist???</seg>
<seg id="5"> Isn't it the same as explicitly tell the corrupt officials to run quickly and transfer the evidence of crime immediately???</seg>
<seg id="6"> What is the intention?</seg>
<seg id="7"> Wouldn't that......Well, I simply cannot say it.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Then again, even if it really works, what will be the result?</seg>
<seg id="9"> Can it check and frighten the corrupt officials?</seg>
<seg id="10"> We do not rule out there are timid ones among them who will confess on their own initiative. However, wouldn't there be more who escape?</seg>
<seg id="11"> Not to mention whether or not the result will be remarkable when the deadline of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection arrives, I am afraid that it will produce another effect instead.</seg>
<seg id="12"> That is, corrupt officials everywhere will all understand tacitly and rejoice secretly. They will all thank the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection.</seg>
<seg id="13"> There is enough time to quickly transfer the assets in a month.</seg>
<seg id="14"> If I were a corrupt official, I would definitely think so as well. I would never declare it to you on my initiative either.</seg>
<seg id="15"> After considering themselves lucky, corrupt officials will also act this way: Haha, thank you......</seg>
<seg id="16"> The people are indeed puzzled. What exactly happened to anti-corruption work? Why is it so difficult to act vigorously, swiftly, and resolutely?</seg>
<seg id="17"> Furthermore, how effective will such anti-corruption work be?</seg>
<seg id="18"> In short, Central Commission of Discipline Inspection, I worry about the result of your limited time combat against corruption.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Non-Privatization of Land Is Bottom Line for My Even Temper</seg>

<seg id="3"> Non-privatization of Land Is Bottom Line for My Even Temper</seg>
<seg id="4"> I believe I do not get angry easily. At least this is how I feel.</seg>
<seg id="5"> When speaking at the forum, I have always been rational and even-tempered regardless. I seldom lose my senses and talk nonsense.</seg>
<seg id="6"> I have also kept my strong faith and ardent expectations in the Party Central Committee all along. No matter how inconsistent the reform measures are with my ideas, I can still accept them and consider them as one of the "special features".</seg>
<seg id="7"> However, if privatization of land starts (or covert privatization), then all these will lose the basis on which they exist.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Rather lose 1,000 soldiers than an inch of land. Only land and resources are the largest social resources.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Working people and land and resources are the essence of a country.</seg>
<seg id="10"> As long as the nature of land and resources remains unchanged, then it is very difficult to change the nature of this country. Well, everything basically changes once the nature of land and resources changes.</seg>
<seg id="11"> I am not a Communist Party member. However, I clearly remember that I made the following pledges: "Cherish my country, love my people deeply, study hard, train well, and be prepared to: devote my strength to the cause of Communism!"</seg>
<seg id="12"> "Study diligently, work zealously, first to bear hardship, last to enjoy comfort, and fight for the cause of Communism!"</seg>
<seg id="13"> People who once made such pledges and called out "We are successors of Socialism" loudly like I did, if you are still not shameless enough, then you should remember the pledges that you once made.</seg>
<seg id="14"> If you have already broken your own pledges, please stand up with a quiet conscience and walk away from "Communism". Don't embrace this signboard to deceive the masses while ponder how to sell it for a better price at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Of course, I wish all these worries were uncalled for. I wish I could keep my senses and composure forever.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Remember, "We are successors of Socialism."</seg>
<seg id="17"> What if there is nothing to take over from?</seg>

<seg id="1"> A Generation with Two Eras of Feelings</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A while ago, someone asked if there are any Mao supporters among the 30-year-olds?</seg>
<seg id="3"> It was later changed to 20 years old.</seg>
<seg id="4"> In fact, people in this age bracket have not experienced the Mao Zedong Era at all. I am not sure whether the brain of the person who raised this question was filled with water or he is born retarded.</seg>
<seg id="5"> In the cities, people who are best qualified to speak on the Mao Zedong Era should be those who had personally experienced it, those who had suffered agonies of that era. In other words, they should be those who were born between 1950 and 1960.</seg>
<seg id="6"> After they were born, their parents joined the movement and did not give their children relative love.</seg>
<seg id="7"> When they needed nutrition, they were just in time for three years of natural disasters and they suffered from starvation.</seg>
<seg id="8"> When they started school, once again, they encountered the Cultural Revolution and neglected a few years of studies.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Some even ended their studies all their lives. They were between 15 and 17 years old. Their studies had not been finished but they were forced to give them up to answer the call of the Party by working in the countryside or mountain areas and supporting the frontier.</seg>
<seg id="10"> After they started working, they believed that the working class was the most honorable so they voluntarily chose the dirtiest and the most tiring jobs.</seg>
<seg id="11"> They enjoyed a short period of glory but have been a looser all their lives.</seg>
<seg id="12"> When they reached the age of marriage, late marriage, late childbearing, and having one child also started from them.</seg>
<seg id="13"> +When their salaries should be increased, businesses stress diplomas. Their salaries were not raised because they did not have any diploma.</seg>
<seg id="14"> They worked hard to raise their children until they were grown. After they finished supporting their children through their basic education and the children were admitted to universities, they again encountered the double jeopardy of educational system reform and state-owned business reform. Tuition fees rose. They were laid off.</seg>
<seg id="15"> With the increase in age each day, they started to get sick. Unfortunately, they are just in time for the healthcare system reform again. As a result, their illnesses are not treated because they cannot afford the medical expenses.</seg>
<seg id="16"> As we can see: All social injustices have fallen on this generation of people mercilessly.</seg>
<seg id="17"> However, not many of these people oppose and attack Mao Zedong.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Why?</seg>
<seg id="19"> They are not slaves of Mao Zedong. They are human beings with flesh and blood and they are a human group living in our society. The history that they personally experienced, from working in the countryside and mountain areas to being laid off, +are squarely the social phenomena of two eras.</seg>
<seg id="20"> Despite their huge resentment and even hatred of the negligence of studies, the lack of food and clothing, and certain undesirable phenomena in society during the Mao Zedong Era, they still think that the Mao Zedong Era was good judging from national spirit, ethics and morals, as well as social conduct.</seg>
<seg id="21"> Parents of some net friends are exactly this generation of people. You can chat with them.</seg>

<seg id="1"> "Injected Watermelons", "Cancerous Bananas", and "Carton Buns"</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> [Saiwaihuangyuan] posted on 2007-07-19 22:02:57 [send text messages] [table view] I remember there was news two years ago about watermelons in Hainan being injected with chemicals with syringes. As a result, it caused a large batch of watermelons in Hainan to rot on the ground and many melon farmers to lose every cent they invested.</seg>
<seg id="3"> CCTV later conducted a follow-up report and the result confirmed that this matter simply did not exist.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The report was bizarre from the very beginning because not only was it of no practical significance to inject each watermelon with syringe, it was impossible judging from the workload as well.</seg>
<seg id="5"> My memory from last year is even clearer. There were media reports stating that the banana trees in Hainan had suffered from a disease similar to human cancer and banana tress that got sick could not avoid dying.</seg>
<seg id="6"> As a result, many people misunderstood that eating bananas would develop cancer. The consequence was the same. The price of bananas in Hainan plummeted, causing banana farmers inexpressible anxieties and endless complaints.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The reason the two reports mentioned above both created sensational effects was that they had directly touched the most sensitive nerve of people, which was food safety issue.</seg>
<seg id="8"> If the media say that certain kind of food will endanger health, then word will definitely spread. People generally adopt the attitude of rather believe it to be true than not toward targets involved. For a person, after all, it is not a matter of life and death to eat a few less watermelons, bananas, and what not from Hainan. However, for the producers and distributors of those products, the impacts are truly serious.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Not long ago, exciting news on food safely broke out in Beijing again. Simply due to an increase in pork price, someone actually used processed carton as stuffing to make buns. This was precisely the carton buns.</seg>
<seg id="10"> I was also deeply shocked after hearing this. I felt that the peddlers were so good at exploration that they could actually think of such a method to cheat people. I also widely spread %pw, this news afterwards and warned my family and friends not to buy any bun when they went out.</seg>
<seg id="11"> However, suddenly, there was news again yesterday stating that the carton bun report was false news. The entire incident was fabricated by one person. Thus, while feeling relieved, I also wondered what happened to the media nowadays.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The truth I learned from a reliable channel was that a certain Zi, a temporary personnel of the column crew of Transparency of the Beijing Television Life Channel, brought the minced meat stuffing, flour, and carton he bought from the market himself and instructed people including a certain Wei to mix the carton into the minced meat stuffing after soaking it in water and make it into buns.</seg>
<seg id="13"> A certain Zi used the home DV camera that he brought along to shoot the production process. He edited it afterwards and used deception to have the video broadcast.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Currently, the public security organ has put a certain Zi in custody according to law and will handle the case seriously in conformity of legal provisions.</seg>
<seg id="15"> After the case of the bun happened, the government quickly organized relevant departments to launch investigations. It also conducted comprehensive and thorough inspection of the breakfast markets in Beijing to ensure the safety of the dining table of the people.</seg>
<seg id="16"> After the incident was confirmed, the Beijing Television had publicly apologized to society. It had learned a profound lesson and had strictly dealt with relevant people responsible. It will also further enhance its management to stop the loophole and end false news stories with determination.</seg>
<seg id="17"> However, even though carton bun was completely unreal, it is still unclear when people will feel at ease to buy buns from stalls again.</seg>
<seg id="18"> This incident also indirectly reflected the great importance the government attached to food safety and its promptness in action. To a certain extent, it also illustrated that the dining table of Beijing people is relatively safe. The bun incident was a false alarm. It could be considered as a reminder to people as well!</seg>

<seg id="1"> To Whom Should Education Be Accountable?</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> I recently heard a friend in China talked about a story of a school. It provoked my reflections and I could not refrain from expressing them.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The incident happened at a private middle school in Shanghai City - Southwest Weiyu Middle School.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The school decided to assign the best teachers to the three classes that signed a contract to directly promote from its own junior to senior high school. Meanwhile, it let a few young teachers who had no high school senior class teaching experience with poor teaching results in the past to lead the other few classes that were admitted to the school from outside schools or those who were promoted without a contract.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Its reason was: Students who signed a contract at that time agreed to abstain from applying for other senior high schools. Therefore, based on the agreement, the school had to assure that it would provide them with the best teachers.</seg>
<seg id="6"> While for students of the other few classes, the position of the school was: Young teachers should be given training opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="7"> I could not help but to sigh. After all, to whom is education accountable?</seg>
<seg id="8"> I remember many years ago when I attended a key senior high school, because of the dissatisfaction with the teaching standard of a Math teacher, the entire class signed a collective request to ask the school to change the teacher without understanding the difficulty of things.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The school actually changed the teacher for us in the end because the commitment of the school to us was to treat every student fairly and to be accountable to every student.</seg>
<seg id="10"> I came to the United States to attend graduate school 10 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="11"> When I was selecting courses for the next semester one summer, I found that the elective courses planned by the department were all theoretical-based courses while application-based courses were not scheduled at all.</seg>
<seg id="12"> I went to talk to the Chair of the Department and told him that I believed there was a problem with the curriculum.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The Chairman of the Department acknowledged that due to a shortage in teachers, application-based course was not offered. However, it would be offered in a year or two once teachers were available.</seg>
<seg id="14"> I remember I told him then, "This is your problem, not mine.</seg>
<seg id="15"> I came afar from Shanghai to attend your school precisely because I was attracted by your course description.</seg>
<seg id="16"> If you are incapable of offering these courses, then do not put them in your description. Otherwise, it is false advertisement. You are being irresponsible to me and my family."</seg>
<seg id="17"> After hearing what I said, the Chair of the Department thought for a moment, then said, "Well, I will see what I can do to resolve this.</seg>
<seg id="18"> It may be too late because all courses have been scheduled for online registration."</seg>
<seg id="19"> The Chairman of the Department talked to me three weeks later. The gist was to tell me that his job was to be accountable to every student including me.</seg>
<seg id="20"> After listening to my opinion, he tried his best to add two application-based elective courses. He hoped that I could understand.</seg>
<seg id="21"> I took a few courses taught by the Chairman of the Department after this incident.</seg>
<seg id="22"> He never held any prejudice against me just because I had lodged a complaint to him. He gave me an A fairly in each course.</seg>
<seg id="23"> On the eve of graduation, I heard his secretary mentioned that he tried his best for every student but not every student was grateful to him.</seg>
<seg id="24"> At the graduation ceremony, as the representative of the Honors students, I told the Chairman of the Department in my speech that we all thanked him for all he had done for us from our hearts because he had tried his best to be accountable to every one of us.</seg>
<seg id="25"> I believed that I had made the right choice in life to choose to study there.</seg>
<seg id="26"> When I said this, I could faintly see that the Chairman of the Department had tears in his eyes... If one day, all educators in China and the entire educational system can both be accountable to every student, then I believe the day that China actually makes rapid progress will be in sight.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Central NY Men's 4s Volleyball Tournament</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> I took part in the Central NY Men's 4s Volleyball Tournament last Sunday. After playing for six and a half hours, our team finally won the championship.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The tournament was in fact a scrimmage organized to prepare us for entering the volleyball competition in the Empire State Summer Games.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The coach broke up the four men's competing teams in Central New York region (high school team, college team, 35-and-up team, and 45-and-up team) and regrouped us into four people a team with a setter in each team to compete.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The rules of the tournament were very interesting. Only the back row could attack. Fake hit to inside the 3-meter line was prohibited. The setter alone could block with no position substitution.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Therefore, it was basically a test of powerful offense capabilities as well as decision making and jockey for position in defense.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Our team had: a 2-meter tall opposite hitter whose offense was a strong point as well as from a high point. He was responsible for over 60 percent of the offense and the scores of the entire match; a 1.85-meter tall setter who blocked many balls dead by himself;</seg>
<seg id="8"> a 1.90-meter tall middle hitter who missed quite a bit of his offense since he was at the back row;</seg>
<seg id="9"> and me, a 1.75-meter tall outside hitter who launched surprise offense from time to time. My success rate was not bad. I was mainly responsible for receiving the opponent's crosscourt smash.</seg>
<seg id="10"> There were seven teams in total. First, we had the round robin. After our team won the first game, the ref repeatedly ruled that our opposite hitter fouled for stepping on the line during offense. This largely affected our team's morale. We were smashed and lost three games in a roll.</seg>
<seg id="11"> However, we calmed down after our losses. Our coordination had also stabilized during these three games. As a result, we began our winning streak.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The round robin ended. Our team had three wins and three losses. We were in the sixth place based on the ratio between the total points we scored and the total points we lost.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The supplementary matches followed. Apart from the top-seeded team, teams from the second to the seventh place played elimination games in pairs.</seg>
<seg id="14"> The mentality and strategies of our team were stable. We played strong and led all the way to enter the semi-finals.</seg>
<seg id="15"> In the semi-finals, our opponents had strong offense but weak defense. My shoulders were bruised from the hitting. However, once I dug a spike, I was twice as happy as when I successfully spiked a ball myself.</seg>
<seg id="16"> I did not even know what the final score was. We just won.</seg>
<seg id="17"> In the finals, our opponent had balanced offense and defense. Our serves foiled their offense quite a bit and we led all the way.</seg>
<seg id="18"> When it was 21:24 in the end, our team had the match point. I received two successive serves from the other team but hit the ball out of bounce at both times. It was 23:24. Our team's opposite hitter ran toward me and said, "No problem. It was only two balls."</seg>
<seg id="19"> The next ball flew toward me again. Fortunately, I received it well. The setter did a backward pass to the opposite hitter and ended the battle with a spike.</seg>

<seg id="7"> We can often find certain good morality among groups that have succeeded.</seg>
<seg id="8"> This is not by chance.</seg>
<seg id="9"> It is because for these businesses or activities to overcome certain immediate difficulties, to unite and put aside religious-based factors, I believe good morality also play a role that cannot be overlooked.</seg>
<seg id="10"> At the least, it can be predicted with great confidence that a group of people with low moral standard can hardly accomplish any successful great deeds together.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Perhaps it is because wisdom to see long-term benefits with rational long-range perspective is a necessary quality for a group to succeed.</seg>
<seg id="12"> In fact, groups always employ various means to acquire identity such as logo, jargon, religion, so on, and also morality.</seg>

<seg id="1"> [Discussion] Throughout Your Life, How Many Times Have You Been Truly Happy?</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> My good friend from senior high school finally got her visa and can set off to attend graduate school at a famous university in the west coast of the United States at the end of August.</seg>
<seg id="3"> A few of our classmates had a little get-together today. We were really happy for her that her wish could finally come true.</seg>
<seg id="4"> I truly envied her when I saw how happy she was.</seg>
<seg id="5"> I thought, throughout my life, the only time I was that happy was when I was admitted to senior high school. At that time, I had never imagined that I would be admitted to a famous school that was one of the best in the city. Afterwards, I attended university and work as a matter of course. I had never been so happy again during that time.</seg>
<seg id="6"> I was admitted to a university but it was not the one that I had longed for before, so I was by no means very happy.</seg>
<seg id="7"> My only hope during university was to be able to go to the north after graduation to join my boyfriend, whom I had been in love with for two years.</seg>
<seg id="8"> However, the Creator played trick on me. One month before I graduated, he suggested to part. All the illusions that I had before went up in smoke.</seg>
<seg id="9"> After that, I simply returned to the north to work. Now, I have been working for almost two years and have made enough money to buy a midrange car. However, I have never been that happy again.</seg>
<seg id="10"> I had a deep understanding of my good friend's happiness when I chatted with her today. She had been preparing this gingerly and with efforts for a year. Finally, she can go abroad to begin a new life without much trouble. The feeling of having one's dream fulfilled really makes one very happy.</seg>
<seg id="11"> I have no plan to further my study, nor do I like living abroad either because I had worked abroad for half a year before and found that the life abroad did not suit me.</seg>
<seg id="12"> When I saw my good friend's happiness, I could not help but to ponder, "What about my pursuit?"</seg>
<seg id="13"> "How can I make myself so happy again?"</seg>
<seg id="14"> Perhaps it is to find someone who truly likes me and is willing to spend the rest of his life with me.</seg>
<seg id="15"> I think I will be moved to tears at that time, just like my good friend told me that when she passed the interview at the embassy and got the approval notice, she could not refrain herself from crying. The yearlong efforts and worries were finally paid off.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Then, what about me?</seg>
<seg id="17"> Time and again, I act with caution and give attention to my relationship. When can my wish also come true so I can cry with joy?</seg>
<seg id="18"> Perhaps I am not promising. I never worry about my own career, but about relationship...</seg>
<seg id="19"> When will my relationship find its destination?</seg>
<seg id="20"> I remain very sad in this matter.</seg>
<seg id="21"> Fellow brothers and sisters, how about you?</seg>
<seg id="22"> Throughout your life, how many times have you been truly happy?</seg>

<seg id="1"> Let's Promote School of Architecture Southeast University</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Haha, consider this an introduction of the School of Architecture for the alumni of the Southeast University.</seg>
<seg id="3"> This is the latest first hand information with personal experience. It is guaranteed authentic.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Dean Wang, Secretary An, Mr. Li from the Personnel Department, and a few other teachers from the Research Institute of Architecture participated in the report. I talked for an hour and then other people talked for approximately an hour and a half.</seg>
<seg id="5"> When the formal report ended, Mr. Zhang (Assistant Dean) pulled me aside and asked me to go talk in the back office behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="6"> He was very amicable. He closed the door and told me that it was inconvenient to say certain things at the formal meeting. He said that he could tell that I felt uncertain about future income so he told me some specific income situations of teachers at the School of Architecture to ease my mind.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Dean Wang gave a brief account of the School of Architecture before the report. He said that there are only six major architectural disciplines across the country. The Southeast University has two, the Qinghua University has two, the Tongji University has one, the Tianjin University has one, and there is none other than that.</seg>
<seg id="8"> He said that the State has put special emphasis on energy conservation in building, environmental-friendly construction, and the science of architectural technology in the past few years. The Southeast University wants to recruit a teacher in this area.</seg>
<seg id="9"> He said that they had received over 20 resumes from inside the country, Japan, and the United States (I seemed to be the only one) applying for that stream.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The School of Architecture took this seriously. It also conducted careful examination of the job applicants.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The Southeast University is indeed relatively ahead when compared to other schools of architecture at some colleges and universities that I know of. The Urban Planning at the Tongji University  should be one better than the Southeast University. However, it seems that the Southeast University is a little better in the stream of architectural design (I did not expect this before).</seg>
<seg id="12"> Dean Wang said that in the past two years, the scientific research funding of the School of Architecture has been abundant. It is a key development university under the State's 985 Program.</seg>
<seg id="13"> He told me that last year, the higher-up allocated a lump-sum of 10 million yuan development funds to the School of Architecture Southeast University, of which 3.5 million yuan was directly spent on purchasing books to substantiate the professional library of the School of Architecture (haha, I also have to praise this. How generous with spending!)</seg>
<seg id="14"> Almost all of what remained was spent on the purchase of experiment equipments of my specialty.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Allegedly, it made a few academicians quite dissatisfied.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Hahaï½ï½ï½Let's say a few words in passing. I think that they were overcharged for some imported equipment.</seg>
<seg id="17"> There is an experiment system used for measuring air tightness of a room that is very popular in the United States. I guess it definitely cost less than US $500. As it turned out, the Southeast University had paid Renminbi 50,000 yuan for it!!!</seg>
<seg id="18"> Other situations included that many schools and faculties at the Southeast University had moved to the new campus in Jiulonghu. However, the School of Architecture insisted on staying, claiming that it has to provide students with a good architectural atmosphere because the old campus still has some classic structures to look at while there is none in the new campus.</seg>
<seg id="19"> Hahaï½ï½ï½since all other faculties had moved away, the School of Architecture seemed to have acquired another building.</seg>
<seg id="20"> Therefore, Dean Wang told me clearly from the very beginning that he can allocate an exclusive office for me in the future.</seg>
<seg id="21"> I felt very sorry that I simply was not aware of anything when Dean Wang mentioned this.</seg>
<seg id="22"> Later, Mr. Zhang pulled me aside and told me that it is not an easy thing to do because there is a huge shortage in office and even some old professors do not have their separate offices.</seg>
<seg id="23"> This made me feel very uneasy. It seemed that I still knew little about the situation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="24"> In brief, I had a great time during the visit to the Southeast University. Leaders and relevant teachers of the School of Architecture Southeast University demonstrated that they were very dedicated and enthusiastic. They had left an excellent impression on me.</seg>
<seg id="25"> May the Southeast University develops smoothly and the School of Architecture continues to stay ahead!</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Taking care of sick children.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Showing "bicep".</seg>
<seg id="4"> Sun Yanzi accompanied the World Vision to Niger, Africa twice after her Congo trip.</seg>
<seg id="5"> At yesterday's press conference, she frankly admitted that it was the most tiring trip ever.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The local weather was hot and the drinking water was muddy. She was also stoned by angry protesting masses while visiting the market, and even riding on a camel, she was scratched.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The entire journey was filled with predicaments, which made her cried out in secret several times, "I want to go home so much!"</seg>
<seg id="8"> Shocked to See Malnourished Children</seg>
<seg id="9"> Sun Yanzi had participated in the World Vision's caring for poor children activities for three consecutive years. She called herself an experienced spokesperson.</seg>
<seg id="10"> She brought 30 bottles of vitamin, 40 torches, and 500 candies to share with local children.</seg>
<seg id="11"> She stated that repeated experiences accumulated showed that no matter how many small gifts she brings, it will never be enough.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The most serious problem in Niger is that mothers do not understand the issue of childrearing at all and children suffer from severe malnutrition.</seg>
<seg id="13"> On her eight-hour road trip from the capital of Niger to the small town of Tahoua located 500 miles away, Sun Yanzi experienced a sandstorm that was rarely seen in the area.</seg>
<seg id="14"> With wind blown dust and rain, the entire sky was stormy.</seg>
<seg id="15"> The jeep she was riding on also swayed in the wind.</seg>
<seg id="16"> When Sun Yanzi thought about that moment, she revealed with lingering fear that even though she was inside the car, she was terrified.</seg>
<seg id="17"> She later heard the locals explained that sandstorm is a symbol of good luck. It brings rain to moisten the land. Only after that did she relaxed a little.</seg>
<seg id="18"> With local residents.</seg>
<seg id="19"> Pained by Mothers' Childrearing Problem</seg>
<seg id="20"> When she arrived at Tahoua, local officials held a one-humped camel welcoming ceremony and invited Sun Yanzi to sit on the camel to receive the cheers of the locals.</seg>
<seg id="21"> However, the camel was scared by the flashlights and was completely out of control. It nearly threw Sun Yanzi onto the ground.</seg>
<seg id="22"> In the end, Sun Yanzi jumped down by herself but her clothes were accidentally torn by the seat cushion. She cut her back and left an 8-cm long small bloody scar.</seg>
<seg id="23"> During this trip, Sun Yanzi visited four local sick children who were severely malnourished. Among them was a four-month old baby who only weighted 2.1 kilos and did not look like a human being at all.</seg>
<seg id="24"> She said, "I was very sad when I saw him. His situation was indeed very serious but it should also be the problem of the mothers. They should be taught correct nutritional concepts."</seg>

<seg id="1"> Club Original: A Few Common Phases in Learning Buffett</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Club Original: A Few Common Phases in Learning Buffett: I Am Strolling</seg>
<seg id="3"> 1) First phase: When one first learns about Buffett, one will feel as if one has found a rare treasure and will immediately put it into practice. However, the shallow and incomplete understanding of Buffett's conceptions always makes one misuse them, use them indiscriminately, and use them blindly. Therefore, results are intermittent.</seg>
<seg id="4"> 2) Second phase: A "breakthrough" in Buffett. After a period of study and practice, almost every "wise man" will consider a few questions: for instance, How should Buffett with Chinese characteristics be?</seg>
<seg id="5"> Should Buffett's theories be applied flexibly in China?</seg>
<seg id="6"> Can we do it better than Buffett does?</seg>
<seg id="7"> Therefore, this phase is mainly characterized by self-righteousness, blind arrogance, and the pursuit of Buffett's theories with Chinese characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="8"> After a period of practice, the results are still always intermittent and non-sustainable. If one is fortunate, it is best to suffer some losses and mend one's way as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="9"> 3) Third phase: Return to Buffett. After a few commotions, one can finally understand that one is an ordinary person and not a genius.</seg>
<seg id="10"> One should have lower expectations of oneself. It is entirely enough to just learn Buffett conscientiously.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The simplest is the most effective instead. Nevertheless, simple methods always embody profound principles. One must understand these principles before one can better implement simplicity to the fullest.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The manifestation of this phase is having little short-term results but many long-term ones with sustainability.</seg>
<seg id="13"> 4) Fourth phase: "Diehard" Buffett. After experiencing sustainable results, one is basically incorrigibly obstinate about Buffett's theories in this phase. His attitude toward non-Buffett's companies is one of total disdain.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Continue to study and deepen the understanding of Buffett as well as put the knowledge into practice. The manifestation of this phase is continuously improved results with sustainability and the progression to a virtuous cycle.</seg>
<seg id="15"> The time each person needs in each phase varies. Both individual situation and luck have a bearing on it.</seg>

<seg id="3"> I would rather write this story in this column.</seg>
<seg id="4"> I hope that everyone can see this article. I do not expect it to become so-called "cream". However, some matters and some principles can often be learned from a short but effective story instead.</seg>
<seg id="5"> This is a story that chills people's heart after reading it.</seg>
<seg id="6"> I truly hope that this is indeed just a story......because I feel really sad......</seg>
<seg id="7"> On the mountainous road, three gunmen actually had their eyes set on the beautiful female driver. They forced the mini-bus to stop and wanted to take the female driver off the mini-bus to have fun. The female driver called for help in desperation. All the passengers on the mini-bus kept silent out of fear.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Only a weak middle-aged man exerted himself at the call but he was hit and lying on the ground injured.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The man was extremely angry. He rose with all his strength and shouted at the entire bus of people to ask them to stop the violence. However, no one responded. They all allowed the female driver to be dragged to the thick growth of grass in the mountain.</seg>
<seg id="10"> An hour later, the three scoundrels and the female driver with her clothes half-buttoned returned.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The mini-bus was about to run again. The female driver asked the weak man who was bleeding from injury to get off the mini-bus.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The man refused. He insisted without yielding.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Hey, you get off the bus. My bus does not take you!</seg>
<seg id="14"> The middle-aged man became angry and said, "How could you be so unreasonable? Am I wrong to try to save you?"</seg>
<seg id="15"> "You saved me?"</seg>
<seg id="16"> "What did you save me from?"</seg>
<seg id="17"> The female driver flatly denied, causing a few passengers to snicker.</seg>
<seg id="18"> The middle-aged man was extremely angry and wished that he would have the strength of a chivalrous swordsman!</seg>
<seg id="19"> Even if he failed to save her, he still should not have to bear the consequence of being expelled from the mini-bus. He insisted on not getting off.</seg>
<seg id="20"> "Moreover, I already bought a ticket. I have the right to ride on the bus!"</seg>
<seg id="21"> The driver looked up and said mercilessly, "If you don't get off, then I will not drive."</seg>
<seg id="22"> To one's surprise, the bus-full of passengers who just turned a blind eye to the violence earlier seemed to have awaken %pw, instead and made concerted effort in persuading the man to get off the mini-bus, "Please get off quickly. We still have things to do. We can't afford the delay!"</seg>
<seg id="23"> A few passengers with strong physical strength even wanted to approach the middle-aged men and drag him off the mini-bus. It reminded people of the scene in Boule de Suif by Maupassant.</seg>
<seg id="24"> The three scoundrels smiled from ear to ear. They gloated with pride and smiled.</seg>
<seg id="25"> A dauntless scoundrel among them said shamelessly, "We guys made her become unrestrained by playing with her!"</seg>
<seg id="26"> The other two scoundrels also talked nonsense, "She is my girlfriend. It's none of your business!"</seg>
<seg id="27"> An argument ended when the luggage of the man was thrown out from the mini-bus window and he was pushed and shoved off the mini-bus afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="28"> The mini-bus moved steadily on the mountainous road again. The female driver brushed aside her hair once and turned the recorder on.</seg>
<seg id="29"> The mini-bus almost reached the mountaintop. It would go downhill after a turn. On the left of the mini-bus was a road built from blasting off the mountaintop, on its right was a bottomless cliff.</seg>
<seg id="30"> The mini-bus quietly accelerated. The face of the female driver was very calm. Her two hands held the steering wheel tightly. Sparkling tears trickled from her eyes.</seg>
<seg id="31"> A scoundrel seemed to have noticed something and said, "Slow down. Slow down. Goddamn, what do you want to do?"</seg>
<seg id="32"> The female driver did not speak. The mini-bus was gaining speed.</seg>
<seg id="33"> The scoundrel attempted to throw himself at the steering wheel and seize it, but the mini-bus was charging toward the cliff like an arrow let fly......</seg>
<seg id="34"> The next day, local newspaper reported: "Tragedy Happens in Fuhu Mountainous District Yesterday, Mini-bus Falls off Cliff".</seg>
<seg id="35"> The driver and the 13 passengers on board did not survive the accident.</seg>
<seg id="36"> The middle-aged man who was expelled from the mini-bus halfway cried when he saw the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="37"> No one knew what he cried about and why.</seg>

<seg id="4"> I am from Changsha. Let's talk about the situation in Changsha first. Everyone needs to pay attention when you go to the Changsha Railway Station.</seg>
<seg id="5"> 1. The forever hard to buy railway tickets: It is absolutely impossible to buy a ticket at Changsha Railway Station at major holidays or when school ends and starts during winter and summer holidays. It is still of no avail no matter how early one waits in line.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The most flawless answer I got was that the travel agencies had booked all the tickets!</seg>
<seg id="7"> However, if one puts in extra money, one can get as many as one wants from the scalpers.</seg>
<seg id="8"> 2. Beware of counterfeit tickets: Tickets in the hands of scalpers are not necessarily real. In Shuangfeng and Xinhua, Hunan, a person relied on fake identity cards to get rich while another relied on counterfeit silver coins and counterfeit coins to make a fortune. Thus, counterfeit ticket is indeed child's play!</seg>
<seg id="9"> Patching up is the most rudimentary form. Some counterfeit tickets are so real that even train attendants cannot differentiate them!</seg>
<seg id="10"> 3. Who moved my bills: Be extremely careful when buying things from stores inside the railway station!</seg>
<seg id="11"> If you want to give small bills, oh, oh, your bills always miss the corner so you have to substitute them with a large bill.</seg>
<seg id="12"> However, after you substitute them with a large bill, the storeowner will say that he has no change for sure and return the bill to you. Then, he will take the small bills with the missing corner. At this time, you will be forced to take a counterfeit large bill back.</seg>
<seg id="13"> 4. Magicians give change: Not all the storeowners will switch your large bills. That is a crime and the risk is higher!</seg>
<seg id="14"> Therefore, some "timid" storeowners have to be magicians. You clearly see that the change that he counted is right but when you have a chance to count it yourself, oh, oh, a few bills are missing.</seg>
<seg id="15"> 5. Foreign wine everywhere: There are not too many teahouses at the railway station. However, you will find out once you enter.</seg>
<seg id="16"> A few glasses of low-grade red wine can be sold at Martini's price. If you do not pay, then your mother may not be able to recognize you either.</seg>
<seg id="17"> 6. Roses and guns: There are many video parlors around the railway station. The titles of the programs shown are very attractive to vulgar men like us regardless. Thus, if you go in to watch, you will definitely be considered as distinguished guest who wants to relax a bit. As a result, a rose MM will immediately come over to accompany you. Of course, you will have to be able to afford the money of five-star hotel consumption. No, broadswords do not always chop at foreigners!</seg>
<seg id="18"> Ice and fire: If you have a Changsha accent or if you are very familiar with Changsha, then never expect to be able to hail a cab at the front terrace of the railway station. The facial expression of the taxi driver can let you know what injustice is!</seg>
<seg id="19"> However, if this is the first time you visit Changsha, congratulations. Even if you are going to a place that is only within five-minute walk, the driver will still take you to admire sceneries of a state-level key tourist city with enthusiasm. He will also let you inhale the famous Baisha brand secondhand cigarette and smell the highly regional areca.</seg>
<seg id="20"> Of course, you need to pay for your own fare, don't you?</seg>

<seg id="1"> Nanjing Subway Driver Should Receive Immediate Psychological Conditioning</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Key word: psychological conditioning</seg>
<seg id="3"> According to report of Xinhua News Agency, an incident involving a death by laying on the track happened inside the Nanjing subway on the night of July 3.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Based on description of the reporter, "Zhu Zhengting, 22, is a young subway driver who had experienced a nightmarish scene. When the reporter saw him yesterday, it seemed that he still had not recovered from the shock. He sat straight on the chair and had a far-away look in his eyes."</seg>
<seg id="5"> Apparently, the young driver had suffered immense psychological shock and is in need of urgent psychological conditioning. Otherwise, it will leave trouble to the rest of his life.</seg>
<seg id="6"> I am not sure if people remember the rescuer in Texas, United States who rescued a girl from an abandoned oil well more than 10 years ago. After experiencing prolonged mental distress, he eventually chose suicide to end his painful life.</seg>
<seg id="7"> At that time, even though he had undergone simple psychological conditioning, people paid more attention to the girl who was rescued and simply neglected the person who needed psychological conditioning more. The tragedy could not be prevented eventually.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Similarly, in the Dover Strait illegal immigrant incident a few years ago, the British police officer who first opened the container allegedly was scared senseless at the scene.</seg>
<seg id="9"> British authorities later put him through psychological conditioning for more than two months before they returned him to normal.</seg>
<seg id="10"> People suffer from immense psychological damage after experiencing disastrous stimulus. During this time, it is very difficult to completely recover by relying on personal strength alone. Psychological scar will always be left behind.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Since outsiders can hardly notice this type of scar, and even if it is discovered, they still cannot do anything either. Many people involved will feel painful for their entire life as a result.</seg>
<seg id="12"> However, in our country, people do not show enough concern for psychological damage. Especially families or administrative departments of the people involved, more often than not, they will abruptly think of it only after the best recovery period has passed, but it is already too late then.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Nowadays, with the diversification of the media, we learn about some appalling incidents all the time. Many female youth were harmed and many young children witnessed their parents suffered from cruel injuries.</seg>
<seg id="14"> After these youth were rescued, we seldom heard that they had received psychological treatment. More of them were offered familiar comfort by relatives.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Even though the victims can feel that they are already safe, the damage they experienced has become an incurable scar that will always be awaken and affects the life of the people involved.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Fortunately, the leader of the driver offered him consolation immediately, which could relieve his psychological pressure.</seg>
<seg id="17"> After all, the driver was not responsible for the accident. In addition, the driver had also adopted measures when he found out the situation. He had done what he should do; only that he did not stop the tragedy from happening.</seg>
<seg id="18"> I believe that even if it were not the driver involved, anyone present would be shocked by the accident that happened at the scene.</seg>
<seg id="19"> Nonetheless, other people are not connected to the person who committed suicide in regards to responsibility. Despite being shocked, it will gradually fade from their memories with the passing of time.</seg>
<seg id="20"> The driver involved is not as fortunate. He must remember and probably will remember it for a lifetime.</seg>
<seg id="21"> We can consider him fortunate if he can liberate himself from this. If he cannot free himself from it, he will always be tortured by such shock.</seg>
<seg id="22"> Modern health concepts are much more comprehensive than those in the past. People began to show concern for mental health.</seg>
<seg id="23"> Regrettably, the mental state of human beings is very depressing. Particularly in the cities, the mental health of people is very unsatisfactory. Majority of people suffer more or less from hidden psychological dangers. Yet, some people still have not raised enough concern when they encounter problems.</seg>
<seg id="24"> Think about the lesson learned from the "Yang Lijuan incident" that happened a while ago. Some irresponsible media outlets used a patient tormented by mental problems as target of media hype, thus causing serious social impacts.</seg>
<seg id="25"> We should avoid this type of incident from happening in the future. Otherwise, our society will truly become a diseased society.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Five Teachers at Dongkou No. 5 Secondary School Experience Myriad of Feelings after First Session of New Curriculum Training</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Key words: Dongkou No. 5 Secondary School, teachers, first session, [new curriculum training] Five Teachers at Dongkou No. 5 Secondary School Experience Myriad of Feelings after First Session of New Curriculum Training  The first group of teachers at the Dongkou No. 5 Secondary School who participated in the new curriculum training had vividly experienced the pressure and incentive of the new curriculum from the morning of July 13 to July 15.</seg>
<seg id="3"> At the same time, they also believed that the new curriculum reform is an opportunity and challenge to the educational development of the school that is hard to come by.</seg>
<seg id="4"> On the morning of the 13th, due to traffic jam resulted from road construction of the highway section between Shijiang and Longhui in Dongkou, it was past 1 p.m. when the few teachers at the Dongkou No. 5 Secondary School and teachers from areas including Suining rushed to the Municipal Education Bureau. Staff of the education bureau, whose time to get off work had long pasted, %pw moved the training materials that were already moved onto the car back down to finish the relevant procedures for us. We also received the training materials.</seg>
<seg id="5"> At 2:30 p.m., the travel-worn and weary teachers braved the sweltering summer heat again to enter the multimedia classrooms at the city's No. 1 Secondary School, No. 2 Secondary School, and No. 6 Secondary School to listen to the lectures of relevant experts.</seg>
<seg id="6"> In the two days that followed, the teachers either listened to lectures of authors and editors of the curriculum or experiences of teachers from provinces that had already entered the new curriculum reform. Some teaching researchers and teachers who had participated in the provincial new curriculum training also gave an account of their understanding and experiences.</seg>
<seg id="7"> On the morning of the 15th, after attending all training courses and taking the examination, the five teachers at the Dongkou No. 5 Secondary School, having studied hard and never arrived late and left early, successfully passed the examination and received the graduation diploma.</seg>
<seg id="8"> During the training, the teachers at the Dongkou No. 5 Secondary School held exchanges among each other. In the beginning, they all felt that the new curriculum was quite unfamiliar, the responsibility was huge, the pressure heavy, and it was hard to grasp.</seg>
<seg id="9"> However, after the training, they all believed that it is also an opportunity and a challenge.</seg>
<seg id="10"> They all determined to work hard to adjust their knowledge structure and try their best to successfully accomplish the mission of reforming the curriculum.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The second group of teachers who participated in the new curriculum training had arrived at relevant locations on the 16th to receive their training.</seg>

<seg id="2"> Key words: Dongkou No. 5 Secondary School holds new curriculum training meeting, [plan]</seg>
<seg id="3"> Dongkou No. 5 Secondary School Holds New Curriculum Training Meeting to Plan Matters in Attending Curriculum Reform Training at Municipal Education Bureau  At noon on July 5, the school held a teacher meeting on the attending of the summer new curriculum training in the principal's office.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Glad to Befriend Stars' Fans</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Key word: stars' fans</seg>
<seg id="3"> I have a female friend whom I have never met before.</seg>
<seg id="4"> I told her directly, "I admire you very much!</seg>
<seg id="5"> It is because you express your love openly."</seg>
<seg id="6"> She likes the male anchor of a popular entertainment show in Taiwan and never conceals this type of feeling.</seg>
<seg id="7"> When the male anchor hosted a show in Jinan, she flew to Jinan. When he made a guest appearance in Changsha, she flew to Changsha.</seg>
<seg id="8"> In the book that the male anchor wrote, he said that a friend presented him with a slingshot with no bullet. She told me with a pleasant surprise, "I presented him with that slingshot."</seg>
<seg id="9"> She also participates in creating an electronic magazine for this star. She reads every issue with me with excitement.</seg>
<seg id="10"> I have always quite enjoyed befriending people who are open about being fans of so-and-so stars themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11"> These stars can be movie and television stars. They can be star players. Of course, they can also be great men.</seg>
<seg id="12"> I never consider these friends shallow. I think they are very likable.</seg>
<seg id="13"> These people are people with true temperament in general. Their likes and dislikes are real.</seg>
<seg id="14"> It is very relaxing to mix with this type of people.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Even though they will not consider your feelings 100 percent, at least you know all their emotions. You also know that you will have bigger sense of security when fraternizing with them.</seg>
<seg id="16"> These people are also very honest.</seg>
<seg id="17"> One should realize that it requires courage to express one's likes.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Precisely due to this reason, many people will like a person but not letting it known for their entire life. In addition, they may even quite despise people who brazenly claim to be fans of so-and-so.</seg>
<seg id="19"> I believe honesty is the biggest strength of a person. Be honest with one's friends and oneself.</seg>
<seg id="20"> However, it is indeed very difficult to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="21"> It also proves that one has selflessness in one's heart if one is able to like a star.</seg>
<seg id="22"> My friends are all fans of some stars.</seg>
<seg id="23"> Sometimes, in order to get a glimpse of the stars, they can endure hardships, sacrifice a lot, live frugally, hold cardboard with their left hand and press the camera with their right with their mouth yelling at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="24"> We can say that they are very simpleminded and naÃ¯ve. However, it requires selflessness to love a person without giving any thought to reciprocation.</seg>
<seg id="25"> It is because in reality, there is too much self-admiration and self-righteousness for oneself and disapproval of others. Therefore, this selflessness seems somewhat precious.</seg>
<seg id="26"> Thus, if all of us are chatting and we say that the stars we like are so-and-so, if one of us says, "I never adore other people",</seg>
<seg id="27"> haha, then we have to be careful.</seg>

<hl>
<seg id="1"> Zhang Xiaohui That Person</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Key word: Zhang Xiaohui</seg>
<seg id="3"> I saw an episode of Kangxi Arrives that I had not seen for ages by chance. The lead was Zhang Xiaohui.</seg>
<seg id="4"> I remember it was the time when she was advertising for Color Blossoms.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The time I watched Color Blossoms was the days when I was obsessed with erotic movies.</seg>
<seg id="6"> At that time, I felt very odd because pornographic movies could actually be shot so aesthetically. Sometimes they were also very interesting by being called erotic movies.</seg>
<seg id="7"> In fact, I have not watched too many erotic movies but they have covered many countries.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The ones I first came into contact were from Korea and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="9"> I later watched quite a bit from third world countries, Latin America, and Europe but less from Hollywood and France instead.</seg>
<seg id="10"> I was unwilling to delete two of them from my computer. One was Youth and the other was Color Blossoms.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The first half of Color Blossoms was still quite good. Everyone was rookie and all put forth efforts in their performances. The director also had high standard.</seg>
<seg id="12"> However, the latter half was somewhat perverted. I could not take it at all.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Actually, what I want to say is that in the program, Zhang Xiaohui said that her boyfriends almost cover every country in the world except Africa.</seg>
<seg id="14"> She currently has four boyfriends.</seg>
<seg id="15"> I am afraid people in general cannot accept this matter. They will say that this person is promiscuous.</seg>
<seg id="16"> However, the crux of the matter is that she was very honest and showed no expression that made people uncomfortable when she talked about these issues.</seg>
<seg id="17"> She also discussed her own view of love.</seg>
<seg id="18"> For instance, the two parties should be financially independent.</seg>
<seg id="19"> I assume it also requires independent personality and being able to control one's own destiny.</seg>
<seg id="20"> It is because I know that love is alive and selfish for people who are in love. How would someone allow the person he loves to accept other people's love at the same time?</seg>
<seg id="21"> Based on my experience and conjecture, most probably, the love of Zhang Xiaohui is no longer tender and romantic. She must be the typical sister-brother-love.</seg>
<seg id="22"> In sister-brother-love, the older sister can tolerate everything including having several little brothers at the same time. Meanwhile, the little brother can bear boundless attachment to the older sister because of the other party's charm and maternal instinct. However, he may not mind whether he is the only one, so on and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="23"> Nevertheless, from the conversation of Zhang Xiaohui, I also found that she is indeed someone who knows how to enjoy life very well.</seg>
<seg id="24"> For example, she loves traveling to the extent of excessively extravagant.</seg>
<seg id="25"> Thus, I also have reason to believe that her life is also very wonderful.</seg>
<seg id="26"> If it were before, I am afraid I still could not accept this phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="27"> It is just like I have also accepted many people now. In fact, it has little to do with being tolerant or not. It depends on once I straighten it out; there is no absolute love or no love.</seg>
<seg id="28"> These people are, for instance, passer-by A, friend B, Zhang Ziyi, good friend D, and also Furongjiejie.</seg>
<seg id="29"> When we look at other people's life, we are spectators. For other people, how can we not be the main characters of our lives as well?</seg>
<seg id="30"> This is as if despite my absence in the world, legends of me exist in it all along.</seg>

<seg id="1"> People Ought to Have a Little Play Spirit</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Key word: play spirit</seg>
<seg id="3"> It is a very tiring matter for people to live. Therefore, they should have a little play spirit.</seg>
<seg id="4"> One should either laugh at oneself, or read other people's jokes and gossip about other people.</seg>
<seg id="5"> For example, one can relax a little at the "entertainment gossip" page at Tianya.</seg>
<seg id="6"> People speak their mind there but of course, you should have the ability to know right from wrong because there are all kinds of nonstop "evils".</seg>
<seg id="7"> The result of "say what you please" is that you do not know what you have said either. However, you need to understand what you read.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Xiao S called Cai Kangyong a "scholar".</seg>
<seg id="9"> If I am also qualified, then I belong to the type who have studied a bit but have not had a thorough grasp yet.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Fortunately, I always know my limitations.</seg>
<seg id="11"> However, I may as well get what I want while I do this bit of studying.</seg>
<seg id="12"> It so happens that I like to take wild guesses as well. As a result, I think while I read. Yet, I have straightened out many reasons and have suddenly seen the light in many matters.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Thus, I gradually form some habits, for instance, I tell myself to be a little tougher on myself and be a little nicer to other people;</seg>
<seg id="14"> when problem arises, first look to myself for a reason;</seg>
<seg id="15"> be more rational when handling matters and more emotional when treating friendship;</seg>
<seg id="16"> and to conduct myself in a low-key attitude, and handle matters in a low-key attitude as well.</seg>
<seg id="17"> However, you know that no one is that good. People will always be selfish, always consider their success and failure, and always in an emotional mess when they should be rational but extremely goddamn rational while they need to be emotional.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Yet, the good thing is that I never think of regret when I deal with choices that I made.</seg>
<seg id="19"> It has been done and I accept the setback.</seg>
<seg id="20"> Why do people have to think about so many useless things?</seg>
<seg id="21"> Fortunately, I am not the type of people who like to wear a stern look to raise my scholarly status either. I am also a philistine after all.</seg>
<seg id="22"> The only difference between me and other people is that I do not have to be cynical. I am more rational in everything.</seg>
<seg id="23"> Alternatively, for instance, I have particularly strong faith.</seg>
<seg id="24"> Once I trust a person, then I believe that everything about him is good.</seg>
<seg id="25"> Even if he has shortcomings, I will still willingly tolerate them.</seg>
<seg id="26"> Even though I am not the type who gather friends around, I am the kind who put myself in their shoes and consider their interests.</seg>
<seg id="27"> However, due to this reason, I am rather strict with screening friends as well.</seg>
<seg id="28"> It is also quite beyond my understanding why so many people still have so much trust in what is said and done in the newspapers nowadays.</seg>
<seg id="29"> Or perhaps in their mind, news stories nowadays still have the type of sacredness that they had before.</seg>
<seg id="30"> However, there are still many things in this world that I do not comprehend.</seg>
<seg id="31"> Joke.</seg>
<seg id="32"> Slap myself in the face.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Song Dandan's The Depths of Happiness, Warm and Moving</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Key words: Song Dandan, The Depths of Happiness</seg>
<seg id="3"> A while ago, I learned from the newspaper that Song Dandan had published a new book titled The Depths of Happiness.</seg>
<seg id="4"> I wanted to read it very much.</seg>
<seg id="5"> It was because I wanted to see how a woman at her age with such a profession sees herself and life after experiencing changes in family and career.</seg>
<seg id="6"> It was not disappointing as expected. I had two thoughts after reading it: First, I was electrified. One can also see one's shadow when watching the life of others. Second, I was greatly touched all the same. They were all details of emotional ties with family and the like.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Why was I electrified?</seg>
<seg id="8"> In the book, Song Dandan wrote, "I have neglected a very important principle in life: Giving is happier than receiving.</seg>
<seg id="9"> I am always busy with giving, busy with making myself happy.</seg>
<seg id="10"> I am incapable of and know little about receiving. I have neglected to let other people give, that is, I have neglected the right +of other people to get happiness."</seg>
<seg id="11"> I discovered that I have always enjoyed this type of happiness as well. Perhaps I should pay more attention to it in the future.</seg>
<seg id="12"> It requires considerable courage for a person to calmly face her past and display all these in front of everyone.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Included in here were her first love, her failed marriage with Yingda, a deep self-examination, and the emotional tie to her son.</seg>
<seg id="14"> There is also one more thing worth praising about this book. It is because being a publisher, it would definitely do its utmost to urge her to stress on things including I Love My Home, House of Flying Daggers, and a series of short plays with Zhao Benshan at the outset.</seg>
<seg id="15"> However, I believe that she must have insisted. She only mentioned a little about Zhao Benshan in the end. As for House of Flying Daggers and I Love My Home, she hardly mentioned them.</seg>
<seg id="16"> +The entire book was full of the realization toward life, love, family, and emotional ties with family of a 40-year-old woman. It was warm and moving.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Busy Holiday</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Key words: holiday, busy</seg>
<seg id="3"> It has almost been a week into my holiday. I have not been idle either.</seg>
<seg id="4"> I attended a meeting at the college. In addition, I have to prepare the materials for next week's meeting and the speech for the conference.</seg>
<seg id="5"> I will be very busy during this holiday.</seg>
<seg id="6"> If nothing unexpected happens, according to plan, I have three meetings to attend and four to five cities to visit.</seg>
<seg id="7"> My life is suddenly filled with many same and different varieties of contents. I almost forget how I spent the holidays before.</seg>
<seg id="8"> It seems that I have never been idle either as far as I can remember.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Only that I originally had a long period of time for me to allocate at one point. Yet, the time seems less this year.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Is it good or bad?</seg>
<seg id="11"> It will be more substantial when one is busy. However, if there is no result or gains for being busy, then its significance will be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="12"> However, sometimes it seems that we cannot consider life completely based on results. Life is for us to slowly experience. Steadiness, peace, fullness, and happiness is also a kind of gains, even though this type of gains sometimes cannot be measured by standard of social judgment.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Everyone needs to have firm belief in social value and personal value. What will we do if the two cannot coexist?</seg>
<seg id="14"> Marxism teaches us to put our priority on social value. It advocates individual to contribute to society. However, in reality, a healthy and sound society should also fully respect the wish and choice of value of individuals and create conditions for the realization of individual value.</seg>
<seg id="15"> These suddenly came to my mind. I found out more and more that Marxist principles are indeed very effective.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Yes, this is indeed what the theory says. However, when it comes to reality, people cannot help but still feel perplexed sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Even when the realization of individual value does not interfere with social value, will any of us realistic individual be satisfied with the realization of our true self and +ignore social judgment?</seg>
<seg id="18"> Or, can our satisfaction derived from individual value break away from social judgment?</seg>
<seg id="19"> It seems very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="20"> Therefore, while all of us try our best to be ordinary average people, we cannot help but to pursue extraordinariness and transcendence at the same time. Yet, we will always blame ourselves if we waste our lives.</seg>
<seg id="21"> This probably is the social aspect of people.</seg>
<seg id="22"> I am still somewhat more relaxed now that I am on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="23"> At least I have time to watch VCDs and play for a while with ease.</seg>
<seg id="24"> For what is worth, work still needs to be done and life will still be lived as before.</seg>
<seg id="25"> I need to go to Xi'an for a meeting again next week.</seg>
<seg id="26"> A city that I have never visited but due to some "preconceptions", I seem not to like it very much.</seg>
<seg id="27"> I hope this trip can change my impression of the city. Haha.</seg>

<seg id="1"> "Live a Very Feminist Life"</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Key words: male, women's right, era</seg>
<seg id="3"> Ying called me on the phone in the afternoon. We chatted for a while and we talked about me watching "Happy Male Voice".</seg>
<seg id="4"> Ying said, "No kidding? You are so cute. You watched Super Female Voice and then Happy Male Voice. You are simply loyal viewer of Hunan Satellite TV."</seg>
<seg id="5"> I said, "That's true."</seg>
<seg id="6"> Ying said that she had watched some talent selection shows of male contestants. She felt that all of them were feminine men. I felt the same. However, I told her that Happy Male Voice had entered the round of five. Next week will be the round of four. The contestants can sing really well and are all neck and neck.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Ying, who studies mass culture and consumer culture, also said excitedly that she has to watch it next week as well. After all, the competition has reached the most crucial phase so it must be well worth watching. She can also accumulate some case resources for future study if she follows these things.</seg>
<seg id="8"> We then said that this is an era of male charm.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Men finally turn from "viewers" into "being viewed" while women, who were the objects in the past, have become the subjects. They can admire and face all kinds of men shows of this era of male charm from the angle of an observer.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Ying said that it is female liberation. It is a sign of Feminism.</seg>
<seg id="11"> She then went on to say, "Don't you feel that you are living a very feminist life now?"</seg>
<seg id="12"> I was so happy after I heard Ying's words that I laughed heartily.</seg>
<seg id="13"> This statement itself was full of feminist implication, only that I do not have Ying's good analysis ability to expound these things in a more profound and clear way.</seg>
<seg id="14"> I like the singing of Chen Chusheng in Happy Male Voice very much. It has a very special sense of reality, a power that touches people's heart and penetrates through space and time. It is very pure and comfortable;</seg>
<seg id="15"> The songs of Su Xing are of a wide variety. He put great expression in his performance. He has fine and gentle facial features but gives people a relaxed and lively feeling;</seg>
<seg id="16"> The singing of Zhang Jie is very resonant and powerful, especially the two songs titled Your Look and The Past Has Gone with the Wind that he sang in the competition today were both old songs that I like very much. They have left me with a deep impression;</seg>
<seg id="17"> Wei Chen has a cute and innocent face similar to Lu Yi. Allegedly, girls find it very likable. Of course, he also has good voice.</seg>
<seg id="18"> The further competition of such final four should be very interesting.</seg>
<seg id="19"> I look forward to watching their wonderful performances next week!</seg>

<seg id="1"> Utterly Confused Kimchi Mood of 6/29</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Key words: kimchi, Seoul</seg>
<seg id="3"> Utterly Confused Kimchi Mood of 6/29  I turned on international roaming. However, once I disembarked the plane, it seemed that the battery of my mobile phone had died. There was still not a single signal bar. Perhaps the turf of global communications means the sphere of the heart. Moreover, it will be effective from the next billing date.</seg>
<seg id="4"> I will lose contact with other people temporarily in these few days. Oh, oh, will anyone worry about me because of this?</seg>
<seg id="5"> I turned on secretarial paging just to prove who is thinking of me.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Whether it is business or personal.</seg>
<seg id="7"> However, the question is, then again, whose longing do I hope it will be?</seg>
<seg id="8"> I do not know when my heart started to turn blank again.</seg>
<seg id="9"> I cannot understand why I always fail to keep the people whom I want to keep from leaving. Yet, some people whom I do not want to keep, they always assume that they can squeeze inside. Does it sound like I am talking about how I feel about marketplace?</seg>
<seg id="10"> However, the heart cannot be stuffed by "white gloves" whether there is a place for you or not, can it?</seg>
<seg id="11"> After all, material and heart still cannot be mentioned in the same breath!</seg>
<seg id="12"> Our car travels on the highway to Busan.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The department head drives without saying a word. I have nothing to make conversation with either.</seg>
<seg id="14"> After all, he neither speaks Chinese nor English. As for me, I also only know a few, a few broken English sentences.</seg>
<seg id="15"> I look at the computer and strike the keyboard rather boringly. Inside the car, besides the sound of the keyboard, there is the cheerful GPRS navigation sound of the Korean woman. Everything is somewhat too quiet.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Only the endless green and the grayish blue sky is left to be seen outside the window.</seg>
<seg id="17"> It is rather unlike my personality to be quiet.</seg>
<seg id="18"> To my surprise, the only thing in this country that gives me a warm feeling actually turns out to be English.</seg>
<seg id="19"> The circles that come into view besides creating an effect of radioactive dizziness on me, they have no other function at all.</seg>
<seg id="20"> I believe that South Korea will never produce compasses.</seg>
<seg id="21"> It is because the market has no need for it.</seg>
<seg id="22"> Seoul was very clean, thoroughly clean, scrupulously clean.</seg>
<seg id="23"> However, unfortunately, the few days that I stayed in Seoul, other than work place and department stores, I did not have time to go anywhere. All my impressions were limited to looking around along the way.</seg>
<seg id="24"> Fortunately, everything was still good!</seg>
<seg id="25"> South Koreans are polite in accordance with their tradition. They smile scrupulously and methodically, listen carefully, and are elegant and calm.</seg>
<seg id="26"> All that I can notice are glorious appearances, traditional customs, ancient structures, and overly modest civilization.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Is this hypocritical?</seg>
<seg id="28"> It might be better to be hypocritical. At least everyone is courteous!</seg>
<seg id="29"> One may think that hideous things do not exist if they cannot be seen.</seg>
<seg id="30"> The food in South Korea is excellent!</seg>
<seg id="31"> Only that I dislike and cannot understand why they spend so much repeated efforts only to make kimchi into assorted hors d'oeuvres with all kinds of things. Of course, there has to be seaweed.</seg>
<seg id="32"> In second thought, South Koreans still have a profound knowledge in food. They can differentiate between kimchi that is pickled above ground or underground and the duration of the pickling with high accuracy.</seg>
<seg id="33"> This indirectly signifies that the meticulousness of the South Koreans may have something to do with having kimchi all the time.</seg>
<seg id="34"> However, I am worried how the Japanese tofu restaurant that the department head is about to take us to will integrate kimchi into its cooking again.</seg>
<seg id="35"> When I thought about the Chinese cuisine that we had last night, I felt like crying. It was entirely Koreanized. The only thing that was palatable turned out to be kimchi.</seg>
<seg id="36"> Oh, ah, thank you for the kimchi that the China Southern Airlines offered with the on flight meal.</seg>
<seg id="37"> The airlines company must have thought that I have to get used to it from the moment I get on the plane.</seg>
<seg id="38"> Two more days and I will return to my country. If there is still no one to miss, then I may as well think of the Pork braised in brown sauce that my aunt will make.</seg>
<seg id="39"> After all, satisfaction of the stomach is more direct than satisfaction of the heart.</seg>
<seg id="40"> Of course, it has nothing to do with kimchi.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Two Trees</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Two trees, one was me and the other was my brother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="3"> We were each other's shade and we took care of each other.</seg>
<seg id="4"> People of my generation all have many sons and daughters. However, I only have older and younger sisters but no older or younger brother. As a result, the arrival of my brother-in-law sounded extremely important.</seg>
<seg id="5"> We were all born poor children. We had to take part in multifarious chores and physical labor since we were very young. Even though I had tried my best to pretend to be a grown man all along and wanted to do the work as good as a connoisseur did, I never had the approval of my father.</seg>
<seg id="6"> I have had problem of sleepwalking ever since I was young but it is not too serious. However, I could not avoid losing concentration when I did my chores.</seg>
<seg id="7"> For instance, my father asked me to plaster the chimney of our old house. I climbed up the roof to operate quickly.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The chimney was plastered but when it rained, the house was +leaking because I had crushed the tiles of the roof.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Here is another example. My father asked me to change the light bulb, the old-styled incandescent lamp type.</seg>
<seg id="10"> When I climbed up the chair, yet, the light bulb I was holding slipped out of my hand and fell to the cement floor, smashed.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Examples like these are too many to be enumerated. Therefore, after my brother-in-law was admitted to the family, the odds and ends small jobs were naturally undertaken by him and were done extremely well and effortlessly.</seg>
<seg id="12"> While for me, I gladly hid in the corner and read those leisure books that seemed like bricks.</seg>
<seg id="13"> We later grew into two trees, two tall trees that could support the veranda of the family.</seg>
<seg id="14"> As for father, he inevitably dwarfed. He, who sat on the wheelchair, became an obscure bush underneath the dense leafy shade.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Who would have expected that the situation suddenly changed. My 50-year-old brother-in-law suffered from serious illness all of a sudden. The tall tree that looked lush green and exuberant was actually, beyond belief, approaching the frightening death.</seg>
<seg id="16"> On that summer day with dazzling sunshine that made people dizzy, outside the operating room of the Peking Union Medical College Hospital, the doctor mentioned casually, "It is not worth operating anymore.</seg>
<seg id="17"> He can live for two more months at the most."</seg>
<seg id="18"> At that moment, I felt as if I was suddenly shot by a stray bullet. My soul left my body instantaneously. I was there panic-stricken like a fool.</seg>
<seg id="19"> I started to sleepwalk again. I saw our family's old courtyard and the young brother-in-law's busy figure in it.</seg>
<seg id="20"> It was my sister's sharp cry that woke me up. I rushed to hold my sister who fell onto the hospital's corridor. We, who were embracing each other, were all tears.</seg>
<seg id="21"> The dazzling sun suddenly disappeared. I suffered from blackout spells.</seg>
<seg id="22"> My brother-in-law soon learned about his illness after returning to our city from Beijing. He was relieved instead after he and older sister cried in each other's arms.</seg>
<seg id="23"> My brother-in-law started to arrange for his funeral methodically. For instance, he told his son, "Take good care of your paternal grandmother for me. After the venerable elder passed away, she has to be buried with your paternal grandfather. This is how the grave should be uncovered during burial.</seg>
<seg id="24"> Visit your maternal grandfather often. Buy him some practical items during Chinese New Year."</seg>
<seg id="25"> For instance, he told my younger sister, "After I pass away, you need to visit your older sister often. She will be very lonely for sure all by herself."</seg>
<seg id="26"> I found as much time as possible to visit him. However, when he faced me, he looked very ashamed.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Words failed ourselves all the time. We were like two plants that despite having life, could not converse.</seg>
<seg id="28"> These were two grown trees. The tempering by trials and hardships had made us capable of facing adversities calmly. Was it still necessary for him to brief me on anything?</seg>
<seg id="29"> It seemed unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id="30"> It was because you knew in your heart: After you passed away, my older sister, the children you had with my older sister, and this big family could only rely on me, this tree alone, to support them.</seg>
<seg id="31"> Who asked me to be born a man?</seg>
<seg id="32"> As a man, you have to straighten your back and shoulder responsibilities without hesitation whether you want to do it or not.</seg>
<seg id="33"> The only regret was: Why did your tree wither that early? You should have a rich and verdant old age.</seg>
<seg id="34"> You passed away on the first day of the New Year.</seg>
<seg id="35"> You left by yourself in loneliness when Chinese all over the world welcomed the new spring with great joy.</seg>
<seg id="36"> Perhaps, there is another young shoot of life emerging in another space and time?</seg>

<seg id="1"> N Minutes in Life</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The reason I have such seemingly trendy title was that at that grim despair moment, the confused brain was simply too busy to consider time.</seg>
<seg id="3"> It was as if an innocent person received a ruling of death sentence for no reason. Would he still nit-pick on the grammatical errors in the arbitral award in a calm and leisurely manner?</seg>
<seg id="4"> It was a day in the winter. The youth settlement was very cold.</seg>
<seg id="5"> I was not sure who was on duty either. The furnace had had no fire all day.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Since it was said that there would be strong earthquake, we did not bother to make a fire when we went back to our place in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="7"> On the big wide bed that sleeps 12 people, the four of us wrapped ourselves in cotton-wadded quilts. Under the dim light, we played poker "three on one" for meal coupon, quivering with cold.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Suddenly, crushing rolls of noise traveled +from afar to near. The few of us looked at each other only for an instant. We immediately realized the arrival of disaster.</seg>
<seg id="9"> We thus flung off the cards in our hands and leapt swiftly onto the floor. We passed through two narrow doors and piled out.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The instant we ran out of the dormitory, the poor stone hut was grounded to dust in a twinkling.</seg>
<seg id="11"> We, who rushed to the courtyard, were like standing on a rocking boat. We swayed back and forth like tumblers and were unable to steady ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Within these few seconds, the structures around us +resolutely gave up their prudent image in the past. They emitted strange "creaking and babbling" cries and danced an almost crazy break dance one after another. After that, they committed suicide by turning into a strand of smoke and dust.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Naturally, the power lines above us were unwilling to be left out of the limelight. They broke suddenly with a "snap" and scattered in all directions just like whips.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Meanwhile, the evil earthquake that wrecked havoc was setting off celebratory fireworks for its creativity all around us. The multicolored earthquake lightning could rival the stage art effects of any blockbuster war movies. The rumbling earthquake noise sounded like battle drum that boosted the morale, torturing every weak nerve.</seg>
<seg id="15"> I only had one thought at that time: The end of human beings has arrived!</seg>
<seg id="16"> I could imagine: The ground underfoot opens with a loud crash while boiling lava sends out blazing invitation as if it were steel. People drop into the lava one after another in free fall like nonentities. They are so stingy that they do not even have a trace of light smoke before they disappear in an instant.</seg>
<seg id="17"> My spine had the wonderful numbness of being filled with ice water. In the gloom, the faces of the few companions were uncertain as if they were paper masks.</seg>
<seg id="18"> I thought: Do human beings bid farewell to this colorful world just like this? Will tens of thousands of years of history of civilization disappear from then on?</seg>
<seg id="19"> However, I am not even 20 years old. My flower of youth has just bloomed and I just felt the delight in being alive. I am so reluctant to leave my wonderful life!</seg>
<seg id="20"> My parents and my relatives, where are you all? What are you all doing at this moment? Are you still alive in this world?</seg>
<seg id="21"> At this moment when I face the repugnant smile of death, I miss you all so much!</seg>
<seg id="22"> ......I was not sure how much time had past. The muddle-headed me finally found out gladly: The earthquake sound was gradually weakening. The trembling of the earth was slowing down bit by bit while the fireworks above me no longer twinkled.</seg>
<seg id="23"> A huge vessel that had been heaving in the stormy sea finally entered a peaceful harbor slowly.</seg>
<seg id="24"> A young heart that was easily broken was eventually put back to its original place carefully after experiencing near insane atrocities.</seg>
<seg id="25"> Earth, my home, you finally allowed us to feel the warmth and affection of a home again!</seg>
<seg id="26"> A warm feeling of surviving a disaster slowly filled the entire body from underfoot like a warm current.</seg>
<seg id="27"> After getting a firm footing, Yu Doudou, who just turned 17 years old, suddenly wailed in the face of the desolate scene of the ruins of the courtyard of the youth settlement that was once harmonious and warm.</seg>
<seg id="28"> All the people were infected and hot tears gushed down our faces.</seg>
<seg id="29"> It started to snow. Was it mourning that fluttered for the misfortune of human beings?</seg>
<seg id="30"> That year, the earthquake in Haicheng killed 1,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="31"> Expert said, "Fortunately, the forecast was in time. In addition, it happened before people went to bed. Otherwise, a major earthquake at a magnitude of '7.3' would have at least seized 100,000 lives!</seg>
<seg id="32"> Only a year later, the Tangshan earthquake that killed over 200,000 people happened.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Matters of the Village</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> There are many families in the village. Among which, the family called Nan is the most annoying. There is a famous saying that is very popular in the village: guard against fire, guard against theft, and guard against Nan.</seg>
<seg id="3"> In fact, the Nan Family is still quite honest.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Some others will usually steal a melon or something from other peoples' fields while the Nan Family will steal a chicken or a dog at the most. It cannot be to the extent that the entire village is isolating the Nan Family.</seg>
<seg id="5"> No one is clean. Whom did our Nan Family offend?</seg>
<seg id="6"> The Nan Family set about holding some honorable activities to make known that this village was first built by the ancestors of the Nan Family, that the Nan Family has always been a large family that grows food, that some famous people in history had also come from the family, and the family has made major contributions to the building of the village as well.</seg>
<seg id="7"> At the same time, the Nan Family carefully invites the village cadres to look around and visit its home.</seg>
<seg id="8"> In short, the entire Nan Family works hard and wants to fight an active battle and better itself.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Not long ago, the Xi Family did a very shameful thing by cruelly persecuting Nan Family's seedlings.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The family named Xi made its name in the village by acting as a matchmaker. Young men from the village all benefit from the Xi Family.</seg>
<seg id="11"> If not for the good matchmaking that Xi Family did, how could you families do well in your production!</seg>
<seg id="12"> However, this time, the Xi Family actually smashed Nan Family's seedlings with black bricks at a place called Hongdong. It was indeed completely abominable. The entire village felt resentful and they all said that none of the people in the Xi Family is good.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The Nan Family went to the Xi Family to demand an explanation. It had gained the sympathy of the entire village.</seg>
<seg id="14"> The entire village all spitted at the Xi Family.</seg>
<seg id="15"> As a result, the battlefield was moved to the Xi Family.</seg>
<seg id="16"> The Nan Family determined to build a nice image before the 17th village meeting to make the Nan Family, the largest growing family, flourish.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Even though the village cadres urge people to get along harmoniously everyday, this village named Zhong is never peaceful.</seg>
<seg id="18"> The most disgusting thing is that in merely two to three months, even the pigs started to clamor and revolt in a hubbub and demand a higher status!</seg>
<seg id="19"> Two years ago, the chickens in all the villages suffered from a flu and they were all killed, weren't they?</seg>
<seg id="20"> Pigs, why don't you be smart?</seg>
<seg id="21"> If you continue to create an uproar and try to revolt, you will be unavoidably killed!</seg>
<seg id="22"> Yet, even though the Mei Village and the Ying Village that are used to treat people high-handedly live an abundant life, they are not necessarily peaceful.</seg>
<seg id="23"> Isn't it scary enough that some tramps knocked down the tall buildings of the Mei Village today and are going to throw small explosive cans in the subway of the Ying Village tomorrow?</seg>
<seg id="24"> As a result, people of the Zhong Village generally believe that even though it is sickening that they cannot afford to live in a room, visit the doctor, and go to school, they can cultivate land, work part-time, and build connections without worries. It is also entering a new era, of a sort.</seg>
<seg id="25"> The Nan Family and the Xi Family, oh, which family does not have its share of troubles?</seg>
<seg id="26"> Let's take the Wan Family who lives at a small bend southeast of the village as example. Even though the parents of the family are somewhat shameless, our great Zhong Village still defends this family as usual, doesn't it?</seg>
<seg id="27"> Seeing that the 2008 sports meet of all villages will be held in our Zhong Village, please save the troubles and straighten the bad children in the village.</seg>
<seg id="28"> All families, raise the lamps and make the fire. Oh, those who have money give money, oh, those who have labor power give labor power.</seg>
<seg id="29"> When the time arrives, people will all go to the village public office to watch golden eggs laid into the nest!</seg>
<seg id="30"> (dubbing outside the picture, fading: golden eggs or silver eggs? Fellow viewers, fellow viewers, I am Yongge, anchor of Cun Television Station......)</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Key words: Eric, Google, Google, China Poster: ordinary staff of Google</seg>
<seg id="3"> I am an employee who joined Google China relatively early. We have undergone many tests in the past two years. We had expected some of them when they arrived while others had indeed exceeded our expectations at the time.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Yesterday, I learned that the company had a special chapter discussing its development in China in the financial report issued this quarter and I heard Eric answered a question regarding China by chance. I had all sorts of thoughts about this so I looked for it in order to encourage each and everyone one of us.</seg>
<seg id="5"> This reply of Google CEO Eric to reporters' queries at the Google Inc. Second Quarter 2007 Earnings Conference Call held last week ( http://investor.google.com/earnings.html )showed that he was very satisfied with the current results that Google China has achieved and that he was fully confident about the future development of Google in the Chinese market.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Eric said that we have outstanding talents in China, increasingly improved facilities, and a product line that continues to enrich its localization contents.</seg>
<seg id="7"> He believed that even though the success of Google may not necessarily be at hand, it is an excellent start for Google China. In addition, drawing on the hard work of the Chinese team, the support of the headquarters, and unswerving spirit, he firmly believed that Google will make amazing achievement in China in the future.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Yes. The important thing is that we keep progressing upward staunchly because we grow up here. We have deep feelings for this place. We strongly believe that Google should give China a lot more. It should give its users a lot more.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Strapless Mules</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Nowadays, top-less is prevalent in everything. Especially in the summer, everyone wish that he or she could just streak because any clothing will make people feel hotter.</seg>
<seg id="3"> You might have known before that T-back, which had been popular for many years, was already defeated by G-String because the latter has absolutely no band.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Therefore, in such an age, the mules you wear under your feet may very possibly be outdated as well because a brand new type of strapless mules that only have a sole have appeared now.</seg>
<seg id="5"> How can one wear them if there is no strap?</seg>
<seg id="6"> We are not celestial beings and the manufacturer does not have magic either.</seg>
<seg id="7"> This type of mules is directly...glued to the bottom of your feet. This is not a product of prank but actual merchandize. The sale price is approximately US $13.5/pair.</seg>
<seg id="8"> This is yet another product that "I have imagined that it exists but do not expect that it actually does". It makes people speechless.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The manufacturer believes that this type of mules is very cool. You do not believe it, do you?</seg>
<seg id="10"> Please take a look: I feel extremely uncomfortable under my feet just by looking at them [via F.C.]</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Key words: Lenovo, ThinkPad</seg>
<seg id="3"> The ThinkPad T61p that Lenovo is about to introduce on July 17 (U.S. time), also the most advanced notebook computer of the T series, has given us a very pleasant surprise: UWB(Wisair Ultra Wideband).</seg>
<seg id="4"> That's correct. Same as the R400 notebook computers, it connects to a wireless expansion slot with high-speed transmission capability.</seg>
<seg id="5"> (via) This style of 15.4-inch notebook computer uses Santa Rosa processor and Nvidia Quadro FX 570M graphic chipset. Of course, the protection measure of a reinforced metal cage-shaped chassis of T61 will sure be included. Yet, the price is surprisingly inexpensive. It only cost approximately Renminbi 15,000 yuan.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Watching Movies Without Screen, Mobile Phone Projector Picture Series Exposed</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Key word: mobile phone</seg>
<seg id="3"> Iljin Display, a Korean-based company, had introduced a laser projector module that is only as small as a coin.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Since the size of the module is extremely small, it can even be built into a mobile phone and a 7-inch projection area can be seen on the wall.</seg>
<seg id="5"> (via) The traditional projector consists of three different LCD panels responsible for the output of the three different video signals of red, green, and blue. Meanwhile, this mini projector can convert among the three colors by using a single LCD panel alone, thus reducing the volume and production cost of the projector.</seg>
<seg id="6"> An official statement claimed that the LCD panel of this type of projector itself is only 0.24 inches and can be easily integrated into a mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Currently, more than half of the mobile phones on the market have cameras built into them. I reckon mobile phones with built-in projector will appear on the market very soon. However, it is really hard to say whether the prospect of the market will be good or not.</seg>

<seg id="3"> On May 30, CCDI set a one-month deadline for corrupt elements throughout the country.  If they fail to voluntarily confess within this deadline, until June 30, they will be arrested.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The humble commoner that I am, on hearing that, I couldn't help laughing; when catching thieves, the police inform the thieves one month in advance, hurry and confess voluntarily or you will be arrested; throughout the world, where is corruption fought like this?</seg>
<seg id="5"> Doesn't this amount to openly informing corrupt officials to hurry and run, to hurry and remove criminal evidence?</seg>
<seg id="6"> What is the point?</seg>
<seg id="7"> Wouldn't it be ... well, there is no way to explain.</seg>
<seg id="8"> However, even if it works, how effective will it be?</seg>
<seg id="9"> Can it restrain and frighten corrupt officials?</seg>
<seg id="10"> We don't rule out that there will be timid ones among them who will voluntarily confess.  But won't there be more of them fleeing?</seg>
<seg id="11"> Let's not mention whether the results are significant now that the CCDI's anti-corruption deadline is approaching, but it did work in another way.</seg>
<seg id="12"> That is to say, corrupt officials all over all tacitly understood, were secretly delighted.  They will all be grateful to the CCDI.</seg>
<seg id="13"> With a period of one month, there is enough time to hurry and transfer assets.</seg>
<seg id="14"> If I were a corrupt official, I would certainly have this interpretation, and I definitely wouldn't go to you and voluntarily declare anything.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Corrupt officials' extreme rejoicing will be expressed like this: "Haha, thanks ..."</seg>
<seg id="16"> Common people are truly confused.  What is going on with the anti-corruption campaign?  Why is it so hard to have a vigorous attitude, to be determined in taking action?</seg>
<seg id="17"> How effective will this kind of corruption fighting be?</seg>
<seg id="18"> In conclusion, CCDI, I worry about the effect of your "anti-corruption deadline."</seg>

<seg id="1"> No Privatization of Land Is the Bottom Line for My Heart's Ease</seg>

<seg id="3"> No Privatization of Land Is the Bottom Line for My Heart's Ease</seg>
<seg id="4"> I don't think I am someone easily angered, at least I feel this way.</seg>
<seg id="5"> I have always been rational and even-tempered when expressing myself on the forum, very rarely losing reason, talking nonsense.</seg>
<seg id="6"> And I have constantly maintained strong faith and ardent expectations for the central leadership of the Party.  No matter how inconsistent reform measures are with my ideas, I can accept these as a "characteristic."</seg>
<seg id="7"> But if, once land starts being privatized (or privatization in disguised form), then all of this will lose its basis for existence.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Lose a thousand soldiers before losing an inch of land.  National land resources are the largest social resource.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Working people and national land resources are the roots of a state.</seg>
<seg id="10"> As long as the nature of national land resources is unchanged, this nation's character will not be easily changed.  Once the nature of national land resources changes, then virtually everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="11"> I'm not a CPC member, but I remember clearly that I once pledged as follows: "Love the country, love the people, study hard, and train well, preparing to: dedicate my strength to the communist cause!"</seg>
<seg id="12"> "Study diligently; work energetically, and bear hardships before enjoying life.  Strive for the communist cause!"</seg>
<seg id="13"> People like me who once pledged this and once sang "We Are the Successors of Socialism," if you are still not shameless enough, then you should bear in mind your own pledge from before.</seg>
<seg id="14"> If you have betrayed your pledge, please honestly stand up and walk away from "communism."  Don't cheat the masses by holding on to this sign on the one hand, while on the other hand calculating how to sell this sign at a good price.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Of course, I hope all these worries are needless and, hope that I can maintain rationality and calmness forever.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Bear in mind that "we are the successors of socialism."</seg>
<seg id="17"> What if there is nothing to take over?</seg>

<seg id="1"> One Generation of People, Two Eras of Experience</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Recently someone posed a question: Are there any Mao loyalists among 30-year-olds?</seg>
<seg id="3"> Later, the age was changed to 20.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Actually, the people of this age group never experienced the Mao Zedong era.  I +wonder if the one who posed this question suffers from a brain malfunction, or a congenital brain defect.</seg>
<seg id="5"> In cities, the most qualified voices about the Mao Zedong era should be those who personally experienced that time, those who suffered much during +that time, that is, those who were born during the period from 1950-1960.</seg>
<seg id="6"> After they were born, their parents participated in political activities and were unable to provide equivalent love to their children.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Just when they needed nourishment, there was a three-year natural disaster, with much suffering from hunger.</seg>
<seg id="8"> As they began school, they ran into the Cultural Revolution, wasting several years of study.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Some even quit school for good.  From 15-17 years of age, without having finished school, they were forced to give up school and respond to the Party's call to go up into the mountains and down into the villages, to support frontier areas.</seg>
<seg id="10"> After they went to work, they regarded the working class as the most honorable, voluntarily choosing the dirtiest and most tiring work.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Glory for a time, worthless for life.</seg>
<seg id="12"> When it was time to get married, it was from them that late marriage, late childbirth, and only one child started.</seg>
<seg id="13"> +When it should have been time for a pay +raise, enterprises required diplomas.  They couldn't get pay +raises without a diploma.</seg>
<seg id="14"> They worked laboriously to raise their children, supporting them through basic education.   When their children were admitted to universities, they ran into the double whammy of education system reform and state-owned enterprise reform, facing tuition increases and unemployment.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Growing older day by day, they started getting sick, and were sadly caught up in medical system reform.  Unable to afford medical fees, their illnesses were denied medical treatment.</seg>
<seg id="16"> As can be seen, all of society's unfairness unsparingly befell this generation of theirs.</seg>
<seg id="17"> But among these people, few oppose Mao Zedong, attack Mao Zedong.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Why?</seg>
<seg id="19"> They were not Mao Zedong's minions.  They had flesh and blood, with their actual lives within the realm of human relations in our society.  They personally experienced the history of going up into the mountains and down to the villages, to unemployment, confronting the social phenomena of both eras.</seg>
<seg id="20"> Though they were greatly discontented with, even harboring hatred toward wasted education, hunger, cold, and some negative social phenomena of the Mao Zedong era, yet: in the view of national spirit, the morality of human relations, and the temperament of society, they still regard the Mao Zedong era as a good one.</seg>
<seg id="21"> The parents of some cyber-friends belong to this generation.  You can chat with them.</seg>

<seg id="1"> "Injected Watermelons," "Cancer-Causing Bananas," and "Cardboard-Filled Buns"</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> [By Wasteland beyond the Great Wall] posted at 2007-07-19 22:02:57 [send text message] [tabular menu] I remember in the year before last, it was reported that some people had used syringes to inject chemicals into Hainan watermelons.  As a result, a large batch of watermelons rotted in the field in Hainan, and large numbers of watermelon peasants lost money.</seg>
<seg id="3"> CCTV later did a follow-up report.  It turned out this incident had never happened at all.</seg>
<seg id="4"> This news report sounded weird from the beginning because using syringes to inject chemicals into individual big watermelons not only lacked practical sense, but also was impossible to do in terms of the workload.</seg>
<seg id="5"> I can recall an even more vivid memory from last year.  Certain news media reported that banana trees in Hainan were infected with a disease similar to human cancer, and that infected banana trees were going to die for sure.</seg>
<seg id="6"> As a result, many people mistakenly thought that you could catch cancer by eating bananas.  The result was the same, the price of Hainan bananas dropped sharply, causing banana farmers to be beyond grief, to pour out endless grievances.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The two above mentioned news reports both caused a sensational effect, in that they directly touched the most sensitive of people's nerves, that is, food safety issues.</seg>
<seg id="8"> If the news media claims that certain food threatens people's health, then the news is certain to travel quickly.  As for the subjects involved, people's general attitude is: better to be safe than sorry.  For an individual, it's no big deal to eat fewer Hainan watermelons and bananas, but for producers and sellers of those products, the impact is way too much.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Not long ago, shocking news concerning food safety exploded again in Beijing: due to a rise in pork prices, people astonishingly used processed cardboard as filling for buns.  This was known as cardboard-filled buns.</seg>
<seg id="10"> On hearing the news, I was shocked too.  I felt these peddlers were too wily, going so far as to come up with a trick like this.  Furthermore, I spread this news far and wide, advising my family and friends never to buy buns on the street again.</seg>
<seg id="11"> But yesterday there was suddenly news that the report on cardboard-filled buns was a piece of fake news, that the whole story was fabricated by one person.  While feeling relieved, I also wondered what has gone wrong in today's news media.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The real truth is, as I learned from a reliable source, Zi, a temporary member of the program Transparency on Beijing TV's Life Channel, brought meat stuffing, flour, and cardboard bought from the market, and suggested that Wei and others mix cardboard soaked in water into meat stuffing and make buns.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Zi used a household DV camera he brought along to shoot the preparation process, followed by editing, then used deception to have the program broadcast.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Currently the Public Security agency has lawfully taken the criminal suspect Zi into criminal detention, and will deal with him sternly according to the law.</seg>
<seg id="15"> After the bun incident took place, the government quickly organized relevant departments to carry out investigations, and launched complete and thorough inspections of breakfast markets in Beijing, to ensure the safety of common people's meals.</seg>
<seg id="16"> After the incident was confirmed, Beijing TV openly apologized to the public, that it had learned a profound lesson, that it seriously investigated and dealt with the relevant persons responsible, and that it will further strengthen management, shore up weaknesses, and resolutely put an end to false news reports.</seg>
<seg id="17"> It's just that, although the cardboard-filled buns turned out to be imaginary, it is still uncertain when everyone will dare relax and buy buns from street stalls.</seg>
<seg id="18"> From one perspective, this incident also reflected the importance attached to food safety issues by the government, and its rapidity of action.  And to a certain extent, it showed that common Beijing people's meals are relatively safe.  Though it turned out to be a false alarm, the bun incident served as a reminder to everyone!</seg>

<seg id="1"> Toward Whom Should Education Be Responsible?</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Recently I listened to a friend back home talk about some news regarding a school, and couldn't refrain from expressing my personal feelings.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The incident happened at Southwest Weiyu Middle School, a private secondary school in Shanghai Municipality.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The school decided to arrange its best teachers for three classes at the school which had directly entered high school from middle school through contract.  Meanwhile, several young teachers with no experience teaching third year high school students and with poor teaching records were assigned to teach classes admitted from outside schools through examination, or from the same school without signing the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The reason was that the contract students agreed to give up applying to other high schools at that time, so according to the agreement, the school must ensure best teachers for them.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Yet for students of other classes, the school's position was: give young teachers a training opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="7"> I couldn't help but sigh with emotion.  Toward whom should education be responsible?</seg>
<seg id="8"> I remember many years ago, when I was attending a key senior high school, with dissatisfaction about the teaching level of a math teacher, the whole class presumptuously signed their names requesting that the school replace the teacher.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Later on, the school indeed replaced the teacher for us, since the school had promised us to treat all students equally, to be responsible toward all students.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Ten years ago I came to America to pursue graduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="11"> One summer, when selecting courses for the coming semester, I found most of the elective courses offered in the department were strong in theory, while none of the few courses strong in functionality were offered.</seg>
<seg id="12"> I approached the dean to talk about it, telling him I thought there was a problem with the curriculum design.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The dean acknowledged that functional courses were not offered because there were not enough teachers.  After one or two years, these courses would be offered when teachers were available.</seg>
<seg id="14"> I remember telling him then, "This is your problem, not mine.</seg>
<seg id="15"> I came thousands of miles away from Shanghai to study in your school because I was attracted by the introduction of your courses.</seg>
<seg id="16"> If you aren't able to offer these courses, you shouldn't put them in the introduction.  Otherwise this is false advertising, irresponsible toward me and my family."</seg>
<seg id="17"> After listening to what I said, the dean pondered for a moment and said: let me see what I can do.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Maybe it was too late, since all the courses were already arranged for online registration.</seg>
<seg id="19"> Three weeks later, the dean approached me to have a talk.  He told me that his job was be responsible toward every student, including me, something to that effect.</seg>
<seg id="20"> He heard my suggestions and tried his best, adding two elective courses strong in functionality, hoping I would understand.</seg>
<seg id="21"> After this happened, I took several courses taught by the dean.</seg>
<seg id="22"> He never held anything against me for having expressed my opinions to him.  For each of the courses, he justly gave me an A.</seg>
<seg id="23"> On the eve of graduation, I heard his secretary say that he had tried his best for each student, but not all students were appreciative toward him.</seg>
<seg id="24"> At the graduation ceremony, while giving a speech as an honors student representative, I told the dean: each of us feels heartfelt gratitude for all he did for us, because he tried his best to be responsible toward each of us.</seg>
<seg id="25"> I felt I had made a correct life choice to attend school here.</seg>
<seg id="26"> At this moment, I saw faint tears in the dean's eyes ... I think that one day, if in China every educator and the entire educational system can take responsibility for each student, China will truly take off soon.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Central NY Men's 4s Volleyball Tournament</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Last Sunday we took part in the Central NY Men's 4s Volleyball Tournament.  The tournament lasted six and a half hours.  In the end, our team won the championship.</seg>
<seg id="3"> This tournament was actually organized as a training tournament in preparation for the volleyball tournament of the Empire State Games summer athletic event in New York.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The coach divided up four participating men's teams from central New York (a high school team, a university team, a 35 and over team, and a 45 and over team), then regrouped them into teams of four players each, including a setter, to carry out the tournament.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The rules of the tournament were quite interesting.  Only back row players could attack, and dropping was not allowed within the three-meter line.  Only the setter could block, and there were no changes of position.</seg>
<seg id="6"> So it was basically testing the teams' power attack strength, as well as defense, judgment, and positioning.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Our team had a 2 meters tall offside hitter, who during attacks held the strong point and high point.  He took care of more than 60% of the attacks and points gained during the competition.  A 1.85 meter tall setter had a number of one-man blocks.</seg>
<seg id="8"> A 1.9 meter tall middle hitter made a number of attack mistakes, since he was in a back row.</seg>
<seg id="9"> And me, a 1.75 meter tall left-side hitter, was mainly responsible for receiving opponents' cross smashes, and occasionally launching surprise attacks at a decent success rate.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Altogether, there were seven teams.  First was a round robin competition.  After our team won a match, the referee repeatedly called foot faults when our right-side hitter attacked, greatly demoralizing our players.  Utterly shattered, we lost three matches in succession.</seg>
<seg id="11"> But after losing the matches, everyone calmed down.  During these three matches, our teamwork stabilized, then we began a winning streak.</seg>
<seg id="12"> After the round robin, our team had won three and lost three, good for 6th place in the group standings.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Then came the additional matches.  Aside from the first place team, teams from 2nd to 7th place were randomly matched to play elimination games.</seg>
<seg id="14"> The mental state and strategy of our team was stable.  Our weapon was power, and we led all the way to reach the semifinals.</seg>
<seg id="15"> In the semifinal, our opponent was strong at attacking and weak at defending.  Though it made my arms black and blue, whenever I successfully took a powerful spike, I was twice as delighted as when I succeeded in a spike myself.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Without even knowing what the final score was, we won.</seg>
<seg id="17"> During the final, our opponent was balanced at defending and attacking.  We succeeded by destroying their attack with serves, and led all the way.</seg>
<seg id="18"> At the end, when the score was 21:24, we had match point.  Two successive serves by the opposing team bounced off my arms as I was trying to dig.  At 23:24, our team's offside hitter ran over and told me that it didn't matter, it was only two balls.</seg>
<seg id="19"> The next ball flew toward me again, and fortunately I took it well.  The setter passed the ball back over his head to the offside hitter, and a powerful spike finished the battle.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Talking about Morals Again</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Regarding free individuals, scattered about, a lot has been said about morals.</seg>
<seg id="3"> I have nothing to repeat in this respect.</seg>
<seg id="4"> What I'd like to say now is about collectivity.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Every now and then, we encounter occasions where collectivity is needed.</seg>
<seg id="6"> On these occasions, for a collective, certain morals are needed.</seg>
<seg id="7"> We can often find certain positive morals in those once successful collectives.</seg>
<seg id="8"> This is by no means accidental.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Because for these undertakings or activities, it's necessary to overcome certain immediate difficulties, to hold together as one, to put aside those faith-based factors.  I believe that in addition, those good moral values are playing a role not to be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="10"> At the very least, a group of people all with very low moral values can hardly work together to achieve great things.  That's highly predictable.</seg>
<seg id="11"> To succeed, it might be an essential quality for a collective to have the wisdom of a rationally far-sighted view of long-term interests.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Actually, collectives often use various methods to obtain an identity, such as logos, terminology, and beliefs, as well as moral values.</seg>

<seg id="1"> (An Exploratory Topic) In life up to Now, How Many Times Have You Truly Felt Happy?</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> My close friend from high school finally received a visa.  At the end of August, she can head off for graduate studies at a prestigious university on the west coast of America.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Today, a few classmates got together.  I was really happy for her, that her wish was fulfilled at long last.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Seeing her so happy, I was really very envious.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Recalling so long ago, I was only that happy during the time when I was admitted to high school.  At that time it never occurred to me that I could be admitted to one of the top schools in the city.  Then as anticipated, I went to college, worked, during that time I never again experienced such happiness.</seg>
<seg id="6"> I was admitted to college, though it was not the one I had earlier desired, so I could not be greatly delighted.</seg>
<seg id="7"> During college, I pinned my hopes on going up north after graduation, to join my sweetheart with whom I had been in love for two years.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The gods did not give me good fortune, and one month before my graduation, he proposed breaking up.  All my past dreams went up in smoke.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Afterward, that is, I returned up north to work.  To date, it has been almost two years since I started working.  I have earned enough money for a decent car, but I have never again experienced such happiness.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Today I chatted with my close friend.  I have a great understanding of her happiness.  Having cautiously and diligently prepared for a year, now she is finally able to go abroad, to start a new life.  That dream come true feeling is truly thrilling.</seg>
<seg id="11"> I have no plans to go on studying, and I dislike life in foreign countries, because I had worked abroad for half a year, and found life abroad unsuitable for me.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Seeing my close friend happy, I couldn't help thinking: what about my dreams?</seg>
<seg id="13"> What can make me feel that happy again?</seg>
<seg id="14"> Maybe finding someone who really likes me, is willing to be with me for the rest of my life.</seg>
<seg id="15"> I think at that time, I would cry with excitement, just as my close friend told me that when she passed the embassy interview and obtained the visa, she couldn't help crying.  She was finally rewarded for a year's diligence and concern.</seg>
<seg id="16"> But what about me?</seg>
<seg id="17"> On the matter of feelings, time after time I've been cautious, working hard.  When can I also have my wishes fulfilled and cry for joy?</seg>
<seg id="18"> Maybe I'm not worth anything.  I have never had to worry about my personal career, yet how about my emotions?</seg>
<seg id="19"> When will my emotions find a place to rest?</seg>
<seg id="20"> On this issue, I've been constantly feeling very sad.</seg>
<seg id="21"> Brothers and sisters, how do you feel?</seg>
<seg id="22"> In life up to now, how many times have you truly felt happy?</seg>

<seg id="1"> Promoting Southeast University School of Architecture</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Hehe, also considered an introduction to the School of Architecture for Southeast University alumni.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The latest first-hand information plus my personal experiences.  Replacement guaranteed if it is fake.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Dean Wang, Secretary An, Teacher Li of the personnel section, and several other teachers from the Teaching and Research Office for Architectural Technology and Science attended for the report.  I talked for one hour, and then everyone talked for about one and a half hours.</seg>
<seg id="5"> After the formal report ended, Teacher Zhang (Assistant Dean) dragged me aside and told me that we were going to have a closed door talk in the office at the back.</seg>
<seg id="6"> He was extremely kind and affable.  Having closed the door, he told me that it was inappropriate to bring up certain subjects at a formal meeting.  He said that he sensed I was unsure about my future income, and then informed me of some particular circumstances concerning teacher incomes at the School of Architecture to reassure me.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Prior to the report, Dean Wang gave a brief introduction of the School of Architecture, saying that in the field of architecture, there are only six key courses throughout the country, namely two at Southeast University, two at Tsinghua, one at Tongji, and one at Tianjin University.  There are no others besides these.</seg>
<seg id="8"> He said that in recent years, the state has attached special importance to energy conservation in architecture, eco-friendly architecture, and architectural technology and science.  Southeast University is interested in attracting a teacher for these areas,</seg>
<seg id="9"> He said they received over 20 resumes applying for research work in this area, domestic, Japanese, and American (it seems the one was from me).</seg>
<seg id="10"> The School of Architecture is very serious about this, and has carefully examined these applicants.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Compared with architecture schools at some other universities that I know, that of Southeast University is indeed in the lead.  Tongji should keep a step ahead of Southeast University in urban planning, yet concerning the area of architectural design, it seems that Southeast University could still be slightly ahead (something I hadn't previously expected).</seg>
<seg id="12"> Dean Wang said the School of Architecture has extremely sufficient scientific research funds in the past two years, with its status as an institution in the state's 985 Project for key engineering construction.</seg>
<seg id="13"> He told me that last year, Southeast University's School of Architecture was given one-off financial support of 10 million from superior units as construction funds, of which 3.5 million was used directly in purchasing books for the Architecture School's specialized library. (Hehe, this is something even I would like to praise a bit.  What a large move!)</seg>
<seg id="14"> The rest of the funds were almost all used to purchase equipment for experiments in my research area.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Rumor has it that several academicians have some complaints.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Hehe ... By the way, I feel the college seemingly got ripped off on some imported equipment.</seg>
<seg id="17"> One experiment system for measuring indoor air-tightness, which is widely used in America and could have been obtained for an estimated 500 US dollars, cost Southeast University 50 thousand RMB in the end!!!</seg>
<seg id="18"> There are other things as well.  Many colleges and departments of Southeast University have now moved to the new campus at Jiulong Lake, but the School of Architecture is determined to stay, saying it wants to provide students with a positive architectural atmosphere.  On the old campus there are some classical buildings you can look at, which the new campus does not have.</seg>
<seg id="19"> Hehe ... it seems that because other departments have moved out, the School of Architecture was able to get another building.</seg>
<seg id="20"> So, Dean Wang told me straightforwardly that later I can be given my own single office.</seg>
<seg id="21"> I am very embarrassed that when Dean Wang was talking about this, I wasn't interested at all.</seg>
<seg id="22"> Later, Teacher Zhang dragged me aside and told me that this is quite difficult and that even some old professors do not have single offices because office space is in extremely short supply.</seg>
<seg id="23"> This made me very uneasy.  It seems that I still don't fully understate the state of the country.</seg>
<seg id="24"> In a word, I had a wonderful time at Southeast University during this visit.  Leaders and relevant teachers at the School of Architecture of Southeast University left a positive impression on me with their extremely professional dedication and enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="25"> May Southeast University develop smoothly, and the School of Architecture keep its lead!</seg>

<seg id="3"> This boss is recognized as a gallant character among women, and treated us subordinates very well.  So we also willingly worked for her, even to the extent of working overtime at night and during weekends, which is rarely seen among Americans.  She is also considered to be the best boss I've worked for.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Because of the need to care for her family and to have more time to educate the children, she left the company and opened a math tutoring center focusing on elementary and middle school students.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Taking care of sick children.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Displaying "arm muscle."</seg>
<seg id="4"> After the Congo visit, Sun Yanzi has followed World Vision to Africa's Niger on a second occasion.</seg>
<seg id="5"> At the press conference yesterday, she frankly admitted that this was by far the most grueling journey ever.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The local weather was hot, drinking water was murky, and while visiting the market, she ran into the locals angrily throwing stones in protest, even riding on the camel resulted in cuts sustained from the camel seat.</seg>
<seg id="7"> An eventful journey along the way made her shouted aloud in her heart on several occasions: "I really want to go home!"</seg>
<seg id="8"> Startled to see malnourished young children</seg>
<seg id="9"> With three consecutive years of joining World Vision activities to care for poor children, Sun Yanzi professes to be an experienced spokesperson.</seg>
<seg id="10"> She brought along 30 bottles of vitamins, 40 sets of flashlights and 500 candies to be shared with the local children.</seg>
<seg id="11"> She said that based on much cumulative experiences, the small gifts are always never enough for use no matter how many were brought along.</seg>
<seg id="12"> In Nigeria the most serious issue is that mothers have no idea at all in upbringing and young children have serious malnutrition problems.</seg>
<seg id="13"> During her eight-hour car ride from the capital of Niger to Tawa, a small town 500km away, Sun Yanzi experienced a sandstorm which was rarely seen locally.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Winds blowing the sand, accompanied with rainwater, the colors changed throughout the whole sky.</seg>
<seg id="15"> The jeep she rode in was swaying even more with the wind.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Thinking back of that time, Sun Yanzi disclosed with a lingering fear that although inside the vehicle, she was still very much afraid.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Only when she later heard the local people explaining that sandstorm is a symbol of good luck, bringing rainwater to moisturize the earth did she feel slightly relieved.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Together with the local residents.</seg>
<seg id="19"> Saddened by mothers with upbringing problems</seg>
<seg id="20"> Upon arriving at Tawa, the local officials held a welcoming ceremony on a dromedary and invited Sun Yanzi to sit on the camel to receive the acclamation of the locals,</seg>
<seg id="21"> But the camel, frightened by the camera flash, went completely beyond control and almost threw Sun Yanzi off onto the ground,</seg>
<seg id="22"> In the end Sun Yanzi leapt down on her own, however her carelessness caused her clothing to be ripped by the seat mat which scratched her back and left behind a small bloody mark about 8cm long.</seg>
<seg id="23"> On this trip, Sun Yanzi visited four local children who were seriously undernourished and ill.  Among them was a four-month-old baby, weighing only 2.1kg, who didn't look like a human being at all.</seg>
<seg id="24"> She said: "The sight of him saddened me.  His condition is really too extreme, but it should also be a problem of the mother, who should be taught about the right nutrition concept."</seg>

<seg id="2"> Keywords: Key to China's Education - Humanistic  Key to China's Education - Humanistic</seg>
<seg id="3"> The purpose of education is to enable those being educated to be further adept at survival and enjoyment in the existing social environment.</seg>
<seg id="4"> "Survival" is easily comprehendible to everyone, while "enjoyment" may be simply comprehended by everyone as "having fun."  In fact it is not so, the "enjoyment" here belongs to a very broad category.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Survival -- includes physical strengthening and mental strengthening</seg>
<seg id="6"> 1. Physical strengthening -- increases physical strength through various physical +activities, strengthens coordination, enabling the exercising ability to be continuously increased, thus sufficiently satisfying the needs of physical activities, as well as the needs in dealings with society.</seg>
<seg id="7"> 2. Mental strengthening -- able to understand more clearly the society one is in, know oneself, learn to deal with others, learn the skill to adapt to survive and experience enjoyment.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The above discusses the purpose of education, with not much of a relation to this article.  Now let's discuss the key point: key to China's education -- humanistic.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The essential nature of being humanistic is: fully understand the differences of individuals and that they can not be perceived as the same.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Club Original: Several Frequently Seen Stages of Learning from Buffett</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Club Original: Several Frequently Seen Stages of Learning from Buffett: I am taking a stroll</seg>
<seg id="3"> 1) Stage 1: Initial acquaintance with Buffett gave you the feeling as though you had gotten an invaluable treasure, and you immediately put it into practice.  But at this time, your learning of Buffett's concept is still not deep, not penetrative.  More often than not, much will be used wrongly, used haphazardly, and used blindly, so it's effective sometimes and ineffective some other times.</seg>
<seg id="4"> 2) Stage 2: "Outsmart" Buffett.  After going through a period of learning and practice, almost every "intelligent person" will be pondering over a few questions: For example, what would a Buffett with Chinese characteristics be like?</seg>
<seg id="5"> Should the theories of Buffett be flexibly applied in China?</seg>
<seg id="6"> Can we do better than Buffett?</seg>
<seg id="7"> Therefore this stage is mainly characterized by your presumption and blind arrogance in your search for a Buffett theory with Chinese characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="8"> After going through a period of practice, more often than not, it's still effective sometimes and ineffective some other times, with no continuity.  If you're lucky, it is best to take a little loss, and turn back early.</seg>
<seg id="9"> 3) Stage 3: Back to Buffett.  After having gone through a few setbacks, You've finally come to realize that you're just a normal human being, not a genius.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The expectations set to yourself should be a little lower, just earnestly learning from Buffett would fully suffice.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The simplest, on the contrary, is the most effective, but simple methods often encompass profound theories, and these theories must be understood before simplicity can be carried out right to the end.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The performance of this stage is not great for short term results, not too little for long term results, and has continuity.</seg>
<seg id="13"> 4) Stage 4: "Stubborn" Buffett.  After tasting consistent results, the theories of Buffett are basically entrenched in this stage, and your attitude toward non-Buffett companies is complete indifference.</seg>
<seg id="14"> You continuously learn and deepen the understanding of Buffett and put it into practice.  The performance at this stage is getting better and better results, with continuity, and entering a virtuous cycle.</seg>
<seg id="15"> For every stage the time needed by each individual varies and is related both to individual situations and luck.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> He is one of my old Internet pals, who circulated such a story in the group.</seg>
<seg id="3"> I would rather write this story in this column.</seg>
<seg id="4"> I hope that everyone will read this article.  It is not expected to become the so-called finest, but some things and some truth can often be appreciated and obtained from a short and pithy story.</seg>
<seg id="5"> This is a story that will make people feel coldness in the heart after they have finished reading it.</seg>
<seg id="6"> I really wish that this is really just a fiction...because my heart feels really sad...</seg>
<seg id="7"> Three gunmen on a mountainous road apparently set their sights on this beautiful female driver, forcing the mid-size bus to stop and wanting to bring the female driver off the vehicle for some fun.  The female driver frantically shouted for help, yet all the bus passengers went absolutely silent.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Only a middle-aged thin, feeble man stepped forward bravely in response, but was beaten up and lay wounded on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The man was furious, shouting and clamoring for all the bus passengers to stop this barbaric behavior, but no one answered.  The female driver was dragged without restraint to the thick bushes in the forestry.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Half an hour later, the three villains returned with the female driver whose clothing was disheveled.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The bus was about to continue on its journey.  The female driver wanted the wounded and bleeding thinly weak man to get off the bus.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The man refused, and firmly stood up.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Hey, you get off the bus.  My bus is not taking you!</seg>
<seg id="14"> The middle-aged man was vexed, and said: You are such an unreasonable person, was I wrong to try save you?</seg>
<seg id="15"> You save me?</seg>
<seg id="16"> What did you save me from?</seg>
<seg id="17"> The female driver denied vehemently, drawing secret laughter from a few passengers.</seg>
<seg id="18"> The middle-aged man was enraged, hating himself for not having the might of a chivalrous valiant!</seg>
<seg id="19"> Even though the rescue was not successful, but still it should not have to result in him being driven off the bus.  He was adamant on not getting off.</seg>
<seg id="20"> By the way, I have bought the ticket, and I have the right to sit on the bus!</seg>
<seg id="21"> The driver lifted her face coldly and said: If you don't get off, then I will not drive.</seg>
<seg id="22"> Unexpectedly, the busload of passengers who turned a blind eye to the brutal act earlier, as though just awoken from sleep, banded together to persuade the man to alight the bus: Get off quickly, we still have other matters, and can't afford any delay!</seg>
<seg id="23"> A few strong and burly passengers even thought of going forward to drag the middle-aged man off the bus, causing one to think of the plot in the story "Boule de Suif" written by Maupassant.</seg>
<seg id="24"> The three villains gloated, grinning gleefully.</seg>
<seg id="25"> Among them was a black skinned scoundrel who unabashedly said: We brothers have played her well!</seg>
<seg id="26"> The other two villains also blabbered nonsense: She is my partner, it is none of your business!</seg>
<seg id="27"> A quarrel ensued, until that man's luggage was thrown out the bus window, and he was pushed violently down subsequently.</seg>
<seg id="28"> The bus was once again smoothly traveling on the mountainous road.  The female driver stroked her hair once, and pressed on the tape recorder.</seg>
<seg id="29"> The bus was reaching the hill-top, and would go downhill round the bend. On the left side of the bus was a road carved into the mountain, on the right was an overhanging steep cliff.</seg>
<seg id="30"> The bus quietly increased speed, and the female driver's face was extremely calm, both hands tightly gripping on the steering wheel, as tears glistened in the eyes.</seg>
<seg id="31"> One of the villains sort of detected something, and said: Drive slowly, drive slowly, what the hell are you trying to do?</seg>
<seg id="32"> The female driver did not speak up.  The speed of the bus became faster and faster.</seg>
<seg id="33"> The villains attempted to grab the steering wheel, but instead the bus was like an arrow that had left its bowstring shooting towards the cliff...</seg>
<seg id="34"> On the next day, the local newspapers reported: Fatal accident occurred at Fuhu mountain range yesterday, a mid-size bus tumbled down the cliff.</seg>
<seg id="35"> The bus driver and thirteen passengers were all killed.</seg>
<seg id="36"> The middle-aged man who was chased off the bus halfway on the road cried upon reading the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="37"> No one knows what he was crying for, or why he was crying.</seg>

<seg id="1"> The Dark Side of Train Stations</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Recently I've been out for a few days.  Traveling by train, I discovered the dark side of various train stations during the summer transportation season!</seg>
<seg id="3"> I wish to understand what is there to pay attention to at the various train stations.</seg>
<seg id="4"> I am from Changsha, let's talk about the condition in Changsha first, everyone going to Changsha Train Station must take note of it!</seg>
<seg id="5"> 1. Train tickets that take forever to buy: At Changsha Train Station, during every major holiday or the beginning and the end of school winter and summer recesses, it is absolutely impossible to buy tickets, even going early to queue would be futile.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The most flawless reply I've gotten from my query was that the travel agency has booked all the tickets!</seg>
<seg id="7"> But from ticket scalpers, just pay more money, you can get as many as can be.</seg>
<seg id="8"> 2. Beware of fake tickets: The tickets from ticket scalpers might not be genuine.  Shuangfen and Xinhua in Hunan got rich, one by relying on fake certificates and licenses, and the other by depending on fake silver coins and fake coins, so fake ticket is really no big deal!</seg>
<seg id="9"> To patch up is of the lowest class.  Some fake tickets masquerade as real ones so well that even train staff can't tell apart!</seg>
<seg id="10"> 3. Who has touched my bill: when buying things in stores at the train station, one has to be extra careful!</seg>
<seg id="11"> If you wish to pay in small change, ha-ha, your bill will always be missing a corner, so you have to change to large denomination bills.</seg>
<seg id="12"> But after you have replaced them with large denomination bills, the shop owner would definitely say it can't be broken up after he has got it in his hand, and still want to accept your small bills missing a corner after returning your big bill, by this time you just have to take back a piece of fake big bill!</seg>
<seg id="13"> 4. Magician gives changes: Not all shop owners will swap your big bill, as that is against the law, and the risk is higher!</seg>
<seg id="14"> Therefore a few "timid" shop owners have to resort to being magicians. You clearly see him calculating the change to be correct, but wait till you have the chance to calculate on your own.  Ha-ha, it's short of a few bills.</seg>
<seg id="15"> 5. Foreign liquors everywhere: There are not too many teahouses at the train station, but after entering you will understand.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Few glasses of inferior quality red wine can be sold at Martell's price.  If you do not pay for it, probably even your mother will not recognize you afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="17"> 6. Rose and firearms: Around the train station are numerous video halls.  The titles of the shows played may still seem very attractive to us common men. So if you enter to take a look, you will surely be deemed as a distinguished guest with thoughts to relax.  Then immediately a Rose girl will come over to keep you company.  Of course you have to be able to afford the expenses of a five-star hotel; otherwise the machete will not always be chopping in the direction of foreigners!</seg>
<seg id="18"> 7. Ice and fire: If you have a Changsha's accent or are very familiar with Changsha, then you can forever give up the thought of getting a cab at the front of the station.  The face of the cab driver can let you know what is called a frosty June!</seg>
<seg id="19"> But if it is your first time coming to Changsha, congratulations to you.   Even if you are going to a place within five minutes' walking distance, the driver will warmly bring you to admire for a while some of the finesse in a state-level major tourist city, and will even let you have a gulp of the famous Baisha brand secondhand smoke, and a sniff of the distinctly local taste of the betel nut.</seg>
<seg id="20"> Of course, you have to fork out the transport fare on your own, don't you?</seg>

<seg id="1"> Nanjing Subway Driver Should Undergo Psychological Counseling as Soon as Possible</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Keywords: Psychological counseling</seg>
<seg id="3"> According to the report by Xinhua News Agency, on the evening of July 3, a suicide was committed on the railway track of Nanjing Subway.</seg>
<seg id="4"> According to the description of the reporter, "Zhu Zhengting, age 22, a young subway driver, met with a nightmarish scene.  Yesterday when the reporter met him, he seemed to have not yet recovered from the horror, sitting upright on the chair, and his eyes looked a little entranced."</seg>
<seg id="5"> Obviously, the psychology of this young driver has been dealt with a huge blow and urgently requires psychological counseling, or would otherwise impair him for life.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Not sure if everyone still remembers an incident that took place more than a decade ago.  The rescuer who saved a little girl from an abandoned oil well in the US state of Texas finally chose to commit suicide and ended a painful life after having gone through long periods of psychological torture.</seg>
<seg id="7"> At that time, though he was put through simple psychological counseling, but, as people placed greater attention on the little girl who was rescued, yet neglecting the person who needed psychological counseling even more, they finally failed to prevent the tragedy from happening.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Similarly, in the Dover Straits smuggling incident a few years back, the first British police officer that opened up the container was said to have fainted in fright on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Subsequently, the British side carried out more than two months of psychological counseling on him before he had recovered and returned to normal.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The psychology of humans will sustain huge damages after suffering catastrophic shocks.  At this moment, it is very difficult to thoroughly recover depending solely on one's individual efforts.  An emotional scar will often be left behind.</seg>
<seg id="11"> As such emotional scar is very difficult to be discovered by outsiders, and even if it is discovered, there is nothing that can be done, most parties concerned will suffer for life.</seg>
<seg id="12"> However, people in our country do not pay enough attention to caring about psychological trauma.  Especially it is often after the optimum recovery period has lapsed that the family members or governing authorities of the parties concerned suddenly recall; it is all too late then.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Nowadays, with the diversification of the media, we often hear of some heart-wrenching incidents, where many young teenage girls were hurt, and many young children saw with their own eyes the cruel sufferings inflicted on their own parents.</seg>
<seg id="14"> After these teenagers have been rescued, they are not often heard to have received psychological therapy; more often relatives are engaged in kinship solace.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Even though victims may feel that they are already safe, the previous hurt has become a permanently incurable scar, always to be awoken, affecting the lives of the parties concerned.</seg>
<seg id="16"> It is gratifying to know that the superior of this driver has given him timely consolation which could also release some of his psychological pressure.</seg>
<seg id="17"> After all the responsibility of the incident does not lie with the driver and the driver has also taken all measures when he discovered the situation.  He has done all he could except for stopping the tragedy from happening.</seg>
<seg id="18"> I believe that even if it is not the driver concerned, anyone present at the scene would have been given a fright with the happening of the incident.</seg>
<seg id="19"> However, despite being given a fright, the others have no connection of responsibility to the suicide victim and can gradually forget over time.</seg>
<seg id="20"> The driver concerned is not so lucky; he has to remember, and probably for life.</seg>
<seg id="21"> If he can free himself from it, he can count his blessings; but if he cannot free himself from it, he will often be tortured by such a fright.</seg>
<seg id="22"> The modern concept of health is more comprehensive than in the past, and mental health has started to be watched closely by people.</seg>
<seg id="23"> It is regrettable that the mental state of mankind is depressing, especially in cities, where the mental state of people is not ideal, and most people more or less have hidden depression, while some people have not been able to arouse adequate attention when they are faced with problems.</seg>
<seg id="24"> Thinking about the earlier lesson with the "Yang Lijuan Incident," some irresponsible media have made the torturous mental issue of a patient as a tabloid subject, causing bad influence to society,</seg>
<seg id="25"> Such incidents should be prevented in the future, otherwise our society will really become a morbid society.</seg>

<seg id="2"> Keywords: Dongkou No.5 Middle School, teacher's 1st phase, new curriculum training  The Five Teachers of Dongkou No.5 Middle School Have Much Sentiments after the 1st Phase of New Curriculum Training  From the morning of July 13 till the 15th, the first batch of Dongkou No.5 Middle School teachers who participated in the new curriculum training began to truly feel the pressure and motivation of the new curriculum.</seg>
<seg id="3"> At the same time they also feel that the new curriculum reform is a rare opportunity and challenge to the school education advancement.</seg>
<seg id="4"> On the morning of the 13th, due to the road repair on sections of Dongkou's Shijiang and Longhui Road causing vehicles to be blocked, by the time the few teachers of Dongkou No.5 Middle School and the teachers from Suining and other locations rushed to the city department of education, it was already past 1pm, and already long past office hours, yet the education department staff unloaded the training materials that were already loaded onto the vehicle, just to process relevant procedures for us.  We collected the training materials.</seg>
<seg id="5"> At 2:30 in the afternoon, the teachers who were dust covered and tired from traveling braved the summer heat and separately entered City No.1 Middle School, City No.2 Middle School, and City No.6 Middle School multimedia classrooms to listen to the lectures by relevant experts.</seg>
<seg id="6"> In the subsequent two days, the teachers either listened to the lectures given by authors of the teaching materials or listened to the teaching experiences of the teachers from the provinces that have already entered the new curriculum reform.  Some of teaching researchers or teachers who had participated in the new provincial curriculum training also presented their learning experiences and gains.</seg>
<seg id="7"> On the morning of the 15th, after listening to all the training courses, there was also an exam.  The five teachers from Dongkou No.5 Middle School, due to their conscientious learning, with no tardiness nor leaving early, had smoothly passed the examination and received their completion certificates.</seg>
<seg id="8"> During training periods, teachers of Dongkou No.5 Middle School had mutual exchanges amongst themselves.  Initially they all felt that the new curriculum tends to be rather unfamiliar, heavier in assignments, have greater pressure, and not easy to grasp.</seg>
<seg id="9"> However, after the training, everyone felt that this is also an opportunity and a challenge.</seg>
<seg id="10"> All were determined to strive to adjust their knowledge structure, and satisfactorily complete the task of curriculum reform as much as possible.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The second batch of teachers participating in the new curriculum training has already arrived on the 16th at relevant locations to undergo training.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Keywords: Fans of superstars</seg>
<seg id="3"> I have a female friend whom I have never seen before.</seg>
<seg id="4"> I told her directly, I truly admire you!</seg>
<seg id="5"> Because you have directly expressed your love.</seg>
<seg id="6"> She likes this male host of a popular Taiwan variety program and never conceals such feelings.</seg>
<seg id="7"> When this male host was presenting a program in Jinan, she flew to Jinan; when this male host went to Changsha as a guest performer, she flew to Changsha.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The male host said in a book that a friend gave him a catapult with no pellets, and she told me in pleasant surprise that "the catapult was given by me."</seg>
<seg id="9"> She also participated in doing up an e-magazine on this superstar, and she'd show me every edition very happily.</seg>
<seg id="10"> All along I pretty much like to associate with some of those people who honestly identify themselves as fans of certain superstars.</seg>
<seg id="11"> These superstars can be movie or TV stars, sports stars, or can also be a great man.</seg>
<seg id="12"> I've never felt these friends to be superficial, and I feel that they are so adorable.</seg>
<seg id="13"> These people are usually genuine in nature, like means like, dislike means dislike.</seg>
<seg id="14"> To be in contact with this type of people, it will be very relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Even though they will not take into consideration 100% of your feelings, at least you do know what they are happy and sad about; and know that there will be a greater sense of security associating with them.</seg>
<seg id="16"> These people are also very honest.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Do you know that with regard to expressing one's likes, some bravery is also needed?</seg>
<seg id="18"> Because of this, many people just silently like one person in a lifetime, or perhaps he might also look down on those who brazenly claim to be a fan of so-and-so.</seg>
<seg id="19"> Honesty is to me the biggest virtue in a person, be honest to friends, and be honest to yourself.</seg>
<seg id="20"> But to achieve this point is actually very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="21"> To be able to like a celebrity also proves that deep in his heart there are selfless elements.</seg>
<seg id="22"> Some of my friends are fans of some superstars.</seg>
<seg id="23"> Sometimes in order to take a glance at the superstar, they can endure hardship and can make many sacrifices, scrimping to eat less, with the left hand raising a banner, and the right hand clicking the camera, while the mouth is screaming away.</seg>
<seg id="24"> It can be said that they are foolish, immature, but to be able to love someone without asking for any returns, this requires much selflessness.</seg>
<seg id="25"> Because in reality there are so much narcissism, self-conceitedness, and nonchalance toward others that this selflessness appears to be valuable.</seg>
<seg id="26"> Thus, when everyone starts to chat and talk about one's likes for so-and-so superstar, if someone should say that I have never idolized anyone,</seg>
<seg id="27"> ha-ha, you must be careful then.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Teresa Cheung, the Person</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Keywords: Teresa Cheung</seg>
<seg id="3"> By chance I watched an edition of the Kangxi Come, starring Teresa Cheung, that I haven't seen for ages.</seg>
<seg id="4"> I think that was when Color Blossoms was being promoted.</seg>
<seg id="5"> At the time I watched Color Blossoms, I was obsessed with erotic movies.</seg>
<seg id="6"> At that time I was surprised that pornographic movies could be made with such aesthetic appeal, and are also sometimes very interesting.  They are called erotic movies.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Actually I have not seen many erotic movies, but they have been from quite a few countries.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The very first ones I saw were South Korean and Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Later I also saw several movies from countries of the third world, Latin America, and Europe, but I seldom saw Hollywood or French movies.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Of these, there are two movies which I can't bear to delete from my computer.  One is Youth, the other is Color Blossoms.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The first half of Color Blossoms is pretty good.  Everyone is a newcomer, putting forth a lot of effort in acting.  The director is also disciplined.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The latter half is somewhat abnormal.  I could not take it at all.</seg>
<seg id="13"> In fact what I want to say is that Teresa Cheung says on the program that she has had boyfriends in almost every country in the world, except in Africa.</seg>
<seg id="14"> At present, she has four boyfriends.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Regarding this, I am afraid average people cannot take this.  They would say this person is loose.</seg>
<seg id="16"> But the key issue is she was very candid when talking about these issues, did not carry herself in any way that would make people uncomfortable.</seg>
<seg id="17"> She also talked about her own thoughts about love.</seg>
<seg id="18"> For instance, both people should be financially independent.</seg>
<seg id="19"> I assume that personalities should also be independent; so each controls their own destiny.</seg>
<seg id="20"> For I know that when people are in love, love is living, is selfish.  How can you allow the person you love to accept someone else's love at the same time?</seg>
<seg id="21"> Based on my experience and assumptions, I think Teresa Cheung's love must not have been simple sentimentality.  It must have been typical elder-sister-younger-brother love.</seg>
<seg id="22"> In elder-sister-younger-brother love, the elder sister can accommodate anything, including possessing several younger brothers at the same time.  Meanwhile, the younger brother can emotionally become attached to the elder sister without reservation, because of her attractiveness and motherliness.  However, he perhaps does not mind whether he is the only one, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="23"> But from Teresa Cheung's words, I also noticed that she is actually a person who really knows how to enjoy life.</seg>
<seg id="24"> For instance, she loves to travel to the point of being +crazy.</seg>
<seg id="25"> So I have reason to believe that she also has a very splendid life.</seg>
<seg id="26"> If this was before, I'm afraid that I would not have accepted these phenomena.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Similarly, I have now accepted many people.  In fact this has little to do with tolerance.  Rather, as long as one straightens his thoughts, there won't be any absolute love or non-love.</seg>
<seg id="28"> These people are, for instance, Passerby A, Friend B, Zhang Ziyi, Buddy C, and Sister Lotus.</seg>
<seg id="29"> When looking at other people's lives, you yourself are an observer.  To other people, how can you not be the owner of your own life?</seg>
<seg id="30"> This is just like: although I am no longer in Jianghu, my legend will always be in Jianghu.</seg>

<seg id="1"> People Should Always Have Some Entertaining Spirit</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Keywords: entertaining spirit</seg>
<seg id="3"> A person's life is a very tiring thing, so we should have some entertaining spirit.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Either satirize ourselves, or see others making fools of themselves, gossip about others.</seg>
<seg id="5"> For instance, go to Tian Ya's "Entertaining Gossip" board and relax.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Inside, everybody speaks freely.  But of course, you should have some ability to tell right from wrong, because various "wrongs" occur all the time.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The consequence of "say whatever you want" is that you end up not knowing what you are talking about.  Yet you should be clear about what you are looking at.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Little S called Kevin Tsai a "scholar."</seg>
<seg id="9"> If I am considered one, then I'd be the type who has read a little bit, but has not yet fully grasped the meaning.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Fortunately, I would always know my own limitations.</seg>
<seg id="11"> But simply put, in doing a little bit of reading, I have gotten some things that I wanted to get.</seg>
<seg id="12"> And it so happens that I like to think aimlessly, so I think while reading, and that way get to understand many truths, many things become suddenly clear.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Therefore, I have slowly cultivated some habits.  For example, I tell myself to be a bit harder on myself, and a bit nicer to others.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Whenever encountering a problem, first search for an explanation within myself.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Handle things with a little bit of reason, handle friendship with a little bit of emotion.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Be a reserved person, do things with a low profile.</seg>
<seg id="17"> But you know, people are not that good.  They will always be selfish, will always consider their own gains and losses, will always be extremely emotional when reason is called for, and damned rational when it is time for passion.</seg>
<seg id="18"> The good thing is, I won't regret the choices I make.</seg>
<seg id="19"> What's done is done, I accept the consequences of failure.</seg>
<seg id="20"> Why think about so many useless things.</seg>
<seg id="21"> It's good that I am not that kind of uptight person, acting in ways to enhance my scholarly status.  I am just an ordinary person.</seg>
<seg id="22"> Only I'm different from some people in that I don't have to be cynical, I'm a little bit rational with everything.</seg>
<seg id="23"> Or for instance, my faith is particularly strong.</seg>
<seg id="24"> Once I come to trust someone, then I believe everything about him is good.</seg>
<seg id="25"> If there are deficiencies, I am more than willing to accommodate them.</seg>
<seg id="26"> Even though I'm not the kind of person who is surrounded by friends, I'm the type who puts oneself in friends' shoes.</seg>
<seg id="27"> But because of this, I'm quite serious in choosing friends.</seg>
<seg id="28"> I also really can't understand why currently there are so many people who believe so much of what's in the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="29"> Or else in their minds, reports nowadays are just as sacred as in the past.</seg>
<seg id="30"> But in this world, there are still a lot of things I don't understand.</seg>
<seg id="31"> Joking.</seg>
<seg id="32"> I slap myself on the face.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Song Dandan's "The Secrets of Happiness" Is Warm and Touching.</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Keywords:  Song Dandan, The Secrets of Happiness</seg>
<seg id="3"> I recently read in the newspaper that Song Dandan has newly published a book called The Secrets of Happiness.</seg>
<seg id="4"> I really wanted to read it,</seg>
<seg id="5"> because I wondered how a woman who has reached this age, having this kind of profession, having experienced changes in family and career, after these, would perceive herself and life.</seg>
<seg id="6"> As expected, I was not disappointed.  After reading it, there were two things that touched me: first, it was like I got an electric shock, for looking at other people's lives can be the same as seeing one's own shadow; second, I was very moved by the detailed aspects of some close family relationships.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Why did I get an electric shock?</seg>
<seg id="8"> Song Dandan wrote in the book: "I overlooked an important principle in life: giving is more rewarding than receiving."</seg>
<seg id="9"> "I am always busy with giving, busy making myself happy."</seg>
<seg id="10"> I cannot, nor do I really know how to receive.  I overlooked allowing others to give, that is, overlooked other people's right to achieve happiness."</seg>
<seg id="11"> I realized that I myself have been enjoying such happiness.  I probably should pay some attention to this matter in the future.</seg>
<seg id="12"> If one can honestly face one's past, present it all to the public, this takes substantial courage.</seg>
<seg id="13"> This book covers her first love, her unsuccessful marriage with Ying Da, as well as in-depth self analysis, and the close relationship with her son.</seg>
<seg id="14"> This book is also worth praising for another point, because the publisher originally must have pushed her very hard to focus on I Love My Family, Ambush from All Sides, and the series of shows partnered with Zhao Benshan.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Yet she must have persevered, with Zhao Benshan only mentioned at the very end.  As for Ambush from All Sides and I Love My Family, they are hardly mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="16"> This book is suffused with a 40-year-old woman's insights about life, love, family, and relationships.  It is warm and touching.</seg>

<seg id="1"> A Busy Vacation</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Keywords: vacation, busy</seg>
<seg id="3"> I have been on vacation for nearly a week, but still haven't had any free time.</seg>
<seg id="4"> I went to the university for a meeting, and have to prepare documents and a draft speech for a meeting I will attend next week.</seg>
<seg id="5"> This vacation is going to be very busy.</seg>
<seg id="6"> If nothing unexpected happens, according to my plan, there are three meetings to attend, four or five cities to go to.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Life is suddenly filled with many contents, of the same and different categories.  I have almost forgotten how vacations were spent in the past.</seg>
<seg id="8"> It seems from my memories that there wasn't much free time, either.</seg>
<seg id="9"> It's only that in the past, I used to have long periods of time that I could arrange myself, while this year there seems to be less time.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Good thing?  Or bad thing?</seg>
<seg id="11"> Being busy can be more gratifying, but if it yields no effects or accomplishments, the importance of being busy has to be discounted.</seg>
<seg id="12"> But sometimes it seems that life cannot be entirely measured by effects.  Life is to be enjoyed leisurely.  Being relaxed, peaceful, fulfilled, and happy is also a kind of achievement, even though sometimes such achievement can't be measured by the standard of social evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Everyone needs to be recognized according to social values and self values.  If the two can't be obtained together, what can we do?</seg>
<seg id="14"> Marxism teaches us to first respect social values, asking individuals to make contributions to society.  But in fact, a healthy and sound society should also fully respect individuals' wishes and value choices, and create conditions for realizing individual values.</seg>
<seg id="15"> I suddenly thought about these, and increasingly discovered that the Marxist theory is really very effective.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Surely, it's true in theory, but sometimes people in real life will inevitably get confused.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Even if realizing self values would not jeopardize social values, would each of us actual individuals content ourselves with truthful self realization without worrying about social evaluation?</seg>
<seg id="18"> Or can our satisfaction with self values depart from social evaluation?</seg>
<seg id="19"> It seems very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="20"> Therefore each of us, while trying our best to be good ordinary and common individuals, will inevitably seek the uncommon and extraordinary; but if life is wasted, we will always blame ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="21"> This is probably one social characteristic of people.</seg>
<seg id="22"> Going on vacation, it has been somewhat relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="23"> At a minimum, I can have time to watch DVDs, can relax and play for awhile.</seg>
<seg id="24"> Just a couple of thoughts, work has to be done, the days go on as usual.</seg>
<seg id="25"> Next week again, I have to go to Xi'an for a meeting.</seg>
<seg id="26"> Although I haven't been to, I don't seem to like the city very much, due to some "biases."</seg>
<seg id="27"> I hope this trip can change my perception of the city, haha.</seg>

<seg id="1"> "Living Very Much as a Feminist"</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Keywords: male, feminist, era</seg>
<seg id="3"> In the afternoon, Ying called me, and we chatted for a while, then I mentioned I watched Happy Boys.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Ying said: "How can this be?  You are so adorable.  After watching Super Girls you are watching Happy Boys.  You must be a Hunan Satellite TV's faithful viewer."</seg>
<seg id="5"> I said that's right.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Ying said she had seen a few male talent search programs and felt that they are just sissies, my sentiments exactly, but I told her that Happy Boys has reached top 4 out of 5, next week will be top 3 out of 4, with all singing exceptionally well, and each being excellent.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Ying, who studies mass culture and consumer culture, said excitedly that she wanted to watch it in the coming week, after all it has reached the most crucial stage of the competition and is surely worth watching.  Paying close attention to these may just as well accumulate a few case study resources for future studies.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Next we chatted about this being a pretty boy's era.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Men finally become the "subject" from being the "spectator," while women, who were previously "objects," become "principal parties" and can, from an observer's point of view, appreciate and face a variety of male talent shows in this pretty boy's era.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Ying said this is a woman's liberation and is kind of a feminism hallmark.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Then she went on to say: "Don't you feel that you are living very much like a feminist?"</seg>
<seg id="12"> Hearing Ying's remark, I laughed aloud happily.</seg>
<seg id="13"> This remark itself is significantly filled with feminism, only that I do not have as good a discerning ability as Ying's to be able to elaborate on these things more profoundly and clearly.</seg>
<seg id="14"> I like the song by Chen Chusheng on Happy Boys very much.  There is a kind of special touch, the kind of strength that pin-points to a person's heart and penetrates through space and time, extremely crystal-clear and very soothing.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Su Xing's songs have got many styles, with plentiful feelings.  His features are elegant and gentle, yet giving people a feel of relaxation and cheeriness.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Zhang Jie's songs are full of resonance and energy, especially the two songs he presented challengingly today, The Way You Are and Past Gone with the Wind, both of which are oldies that I like very much, with a deep impression.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Wei Chen bears a resemblance to Lu Yi's cute and fresh face.  He was said to be well liked by girls, and of course the voice is not bad too.</seg>
<seg id="18"> With these top four contesting at the next stage, this should be good to watch.</seg>
<seg id="19"> I'm looking forward to watching their exciting performance next week!</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Keywords: Kimchi, Seoul</seg>
<seg id="3"> Jun. 29, A Day of Confused and Mixed "Kimchi" Feeling  International roaming has been activated, but after disembarking from the plane, the cellular phone seems as though to have a flat battery, still not displaying even one bar of reception, perhaps the extent of global roaming refers to the reach of the heart, and takes effect only upon the next payment due date.</seg>
<seg id="4"> For the next few days, I will be out of touch with everyone for a brief period.  Ha-ha, will anyone worry for me as a result?</seg>
<seg id="5"> Switching on the voicemail service is only a wish to prove who are the ones missing me.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Whether it is for business or personal.</seg>
<seg id="7"> But the issue is, who do I wish to be missed by?</seg>
<seg id="8"> My heart, I wonder when it has started, is becoming blank again.</seg>
<seg id="9"> I don't understand why there will always be some people whom you wish for them to stay but just can't hold them back, while there will be those whom you don't wish for them to stay but they always think that they can squeeze themselves in.  Is this like discussing the business world?</seg>
<seg id="10"> But can the heart, regardless whether there is a place for you or not, always allow itself to be stuffed with these "white gloves?"</seg>
<seg id="11"> After all, materialism and the heart just cannot be equally compared!</seg>
<seg id="12"> Our vehicle is driving along the highway to Busan.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The department chief is driving without uttering a word, and there's nothing for me to speak up either,</seg>
<seg id="14"> After all he does not understand Chinese nor comprehend English, while I merely speak a few expressions in broken English.</seg>
<seg id="15"> I'm looking at the computer and striking on the keyboard in considerable boredom, besides the noise of the keyboard in the vehicle, there's the cheerful voice of the Korean girl from the GPRS navigation device, and everything seems to be exceptionally calm.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Out of the window, all that could be seen is merely the uninterrupted greenery and grayish blue sky.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Keeping silent doesn't seem much to be my character.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Unexpectedly, English is the only thing that induced a sense of endearment to me in this country,</seg>
<seg id="19"> To me, the scene of circles appearing before my eyes no longer has any other function except for inducing the effect of dizziness caused by radiation.</seg>
<seg id="20"> I think, Korea will definitely not be producing compasses.</seg>
<seg id="21"> Because, there is no demand in the market.</seg>
<seg id="22"> Seoul is very clean, thoroughly clean, meticulously clean.</seg>
<seg id="23"> Unfortunately, during my few days of stay in Seoul, I didn't have the time to visit other places besides the work place and the department store; all impression was limited purely to the views along the road.</seg>
<seg id="24"> Fortunately, everything still remains lovely!</seg>
<seg id="25"> Koreans are traditionally courteous, a methodical smile, intent listening, refined and sedate,</seg>
<seg id="26"> All that can be observed is the beautiful appearance, traditional customs, ancient architectures, and the scrupulous civilization.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Is this hypocritical?</seg>
<seg id="28"> It is still better to be hypocritical, at least everyone is polite!</seg>
<seg id="29"> The ugly side of things that is not seen may be perceived as non-existent.</seg>
<seg id="30"> Korea cuisine is excellent!</seg>
<seg id="31"> Just that I don't like and don't understand why is it that all the choices here and there are just kimchi presented in different forms and assortment, and of course, seaweed is indispensable too.</seg>
<seg id="32"> In retrospect, Koreans are very adept in their gastronomical knowledge.  They can differentiate the difference between kimchi preserved above ground or underground, as well as the length of time, where the precision can be down to the minute.</seg>
<seg id="33"> This indirectly shows that the conscientiousness of Koreans may be related to their consumption of kimchi from morning till night.</seg>
<seg id="34"> The only headache is that I don't know what kind of recipe combining kimchi will be used at that Japanese Tofu Restaurant the department chief is bringing us to.</seg>
<seg id="35"> Recalling the Chinese cuisine last night, I sort of felt like crying.  The dishes were all localized to suit the Korean taste, and the only thing edible ended up to be kimchi.</seg>
<seg id="36"> Ah, thanks to China Southern Airlines that provides kimchi along with its in-flight meal.</seg>
<seg id="37"> The airline must think that I should start adapting right from the moment I board the plane.</seg>
<seg id="38"> Two more days to go before I return to my country.  If there is still no one I might miss, then it is better off to reminisce the braised meat prepared by Auntie.</seg>
<seg id="39"> After all, contentment of the stomach is relatively more direct than the heart.</seg>
<seg id="40"> Naturally, this has nothing to do with kimchi.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Two Trees</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Two trees, one is me, the other was my brother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="3"> We mutually provided shade and took care of each other.</seg>
<seg id="4"> People of my generation typically have many children, but I only have elder and younger sisters, no brothers at all, hence the appearance of my brother-in-law was extremely important.</seg>
<seg id="5"> We are all kids from poor background, joining in the numerous family chores since young.  Although I had been striving to put on a manly front all along and wishing to complete the tasks like an expert, recognition from my father was never received.</seg>
<seg id="6"> I had the disorder of sleep walking since young.  Though not too serious, it was inevitable that I was absent-minded when doing the house chores.</seg>
<seg id="7"> For example, my dad wanted me to patch up some cement to the chimney of our old house, and I deftly climbed up the roof to do it.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The chimney was patched up fine, but when rain came, the house leaked with water, the reason being that I had trampled on the roof tiles and broke them.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Take for another example, my dad asked me to change the light bulb, the kind with old fashioned incandescent bulbs.</seg>
<seg id="10"> By the time I stepped onto the stool, the bulb had instead dropped from the grip of my hands onto the concrete floor and shattered.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Examples like these are too numerous to give; therefore when my brother-in-law entered my family, these nitty-gritty tasks were naturally undertaken by him, and they were beautifully done, not requiring any outlay of labor cost.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Meanwhile, I was happily stashed away in a corner reading those brick-like books leisurely.</seg>
<seg id="13"> After that we grew into two trees, two large trees that could sufficiently support the pillar of a family.</seg>
<seg id="14"> And my dad was inevitably diminished, and sitting in his wheelchair, he has become an anonymous shrub under the dense shade.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Who would have expected the sudden change in situation when my 50-year old brother-in-law suddenly came down with a serious illness.  It was hard to believe that this green and luxuriant big tree on the surface was approaching that fearful death.</seg>
<seg id="16"> On that dazzlingly sunny summer day, just outside of the operation room in Peking Union Medical College Hospital, the doctor delicately said: There is no value in surgery anymore.</seg>
<seg id="17"> At most he can live for another two months.</seg>
<seg id="18"> At that moment I felt like I was suddenly being shot by a stray bullet; my soul had instantly left my body, and I stood there rigidly like an idiot.</seg>
<seg id="19"> I started to sleep walk again, seeing the old courtyard of our house, and the busy figure of my young brother-in-law in the courtyard.</seg>
<seg id="20"> It was the screech of my elder sister that awoke me.  I hurriedly ran to hug my sister who had collapsed on the corridor of the hospital; our tears flowed all over our faces as we hugged together.</seg>
<seg id="21"> The bright sun had suddenly disappeared, and darkness formed before my eyes.</seg>
<seg id="22"> After returning to our city from Beijing, my brother-in-law knew of his own condition very quickly, and after a session of bitter crying with my elder sister, his mood returned back to normal instead.</seg>
<seg id="23"> My brother-in-law started to methodically go about his after death arrangements, for example, telling his own son: take care of your granny for me; her remains are to be placed together with your granddad's after her death, and this is how the tomb should be opened up to put the bones together.</seg>
<seg id="24"> Go and visit your maternal grandfather often, and buy some practical stuff for him to use on holidays and New Year.</seg>
<seg id="25"> For example, he said to my younger sister: After I leave, you must come often to see your elder sister, for she will definitely feel very lonely being all alone.</seg>
<seg id="26"> I did my best to find time to visit him.  When facing me, he looked regretful instead.</seg>
<seg id="27"> We often had nothing to say facing each other, just like two trees unable to speak to each other though they are alive.</seg>
<seg id="28"> These are two grown trees, the training and experience from the elements have made us able to face difficulties calmly, what is there to relay to me?</seg>
<seg id="29"> It seemed that there was no need to do so.</seg>
<seg id="30"> Because you know in your heart: After you leave, my elder sister, and your children with my elder sister, and this big family, can only depend on this tree which is me for sole support.</seg>
<seg id="31"> Why am I born a man?</seg>
<seg id="32"> As a man, regardless whether you are willing or not, you have to lift up your shoulders without hesitation and undertake the duty.</seg>
<seg id="33"> The only regretful thing is: Why would your tree wither so early, shouldn't you have a rich and splendid old age?</seg>
<seg id="34"> The day you left was the first day of the Chinese New Year.</seg>
<seg id="35"> It was a time when Chinese all over the world happily ushered in the new spring, yet you left on your own.</seg>
<seg id="36"> Perhaps in another dimension, there is the birth of yet another new young life?</seg>

<seg id="1"> The N-minutes of Life</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The reason to have such a fashionable looking topic is because in that moment of extreme despair, the hazy mind is absolutely too occupied to care about time.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Like an innocent one, receiving a death sentence ruling out of thin air, can he still calmly challenge the grammar errors in the "verdict?"</seg>
<seg id="4"> That was a winter's day, and it was cold in the youth section.</seg>
<seg id="5"> I don't know who was on duty for the day, and there was no fire set up in the fireplace for the whole day.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Because there were rumors of strong earthquake, upon returning back indoors in the evening, we were just too lazy to start the fire again.</seg>
<seg id="7"> On the long wide bed which could sleep 12 people, the four of us wrapped ourselves in cotton quilts, and were playing the poker game of "3-beat-1" while trembling under the dim lights, to win our meal tickets.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Suddenly, a surging noise from afar was approaching.  The few of us looked at one another just for a brief moment and immediately became aware of the impending catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="9"> So we threw aside the cards in our hands, threw ourselves to the ground, squeezed through two narrow room doors, and swarmed out.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Just at that moment when we ran out from our dormitory, that poor thatched cottage laid from stones was reduced to rubbles in a flash.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Those of us who rushed to the courtyard felt as if we were standing on a staggering boat, like a tumbler rocking front and back, unable to stand steady.</seg>
<seg id="12"> In those few seconds, all the buildings around us, +contrary to the past stable images, were emitting weird "creaking" sounds one after another, swaying to a close to frenetic break dance before being reduced to a grimy death.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The overhead electrical cable lines were naturally unwilling to be left out, "bang" and broken, they scattered like whips in all directions.</seg>
<seg id="14"> And in front and behind of us, the raging earthquake demon was displaying its fireworks in celebration of its own creativity, the multi-colored flashes of earth light could compete with the visual effects of any major war film and the rumbling sounds from the ground, like the battle drumbeats, were torturing every fragile nerve tract.</seg>
<seg id="15"> There was only one thought in my mind: Doomsday has already arrived for mankind!</seg>
<seg id="16"> I can imagine: The earth under my feet abruptly opens up, while the boiling magma issues a blazing invitation like the steel melt, mankind starts free-falling like mole crickets and ants in droves into the magna, too stingy to leave even a trace of blue smoke, all vanishing instantly.</seg>
<seg id="17"> My spine felt a pleasant numbness as if icy water was being injected; the faces of my few companions were like paper masks floating in and out of the dimness.</seg>
<seg id="18"> I was thinking: Was mankind just going to say goodbye to this colorful world this way?  Were tens of thousands of years of civilization vanishing without a trace from this moment on?</seg>
<seg id="19"> But I was not even 20 years old yet, the flowery youth had just blossomed, and the perception of joy in life was just forming, I was so reluctant to part from this beautiful life!</seg>
<seg id="20"> My parents and my loved ones, where are all of you, what are you doing, are you all still alive in this world?</seg>
<seg id="21"> Facing the sneering face of death at this moment, how I miss you!</seg>
<seg id="22"> ...I didn't know how much time had passed before the muddle-headed me finally discovered in joy that the sound coming from the ground was gradually weakening, with the shaking of the earth getting slower and slower, and the fireworks above my head were no longer scintillating.</seg>
<seg id="23"> A giant battleship tossing in the terrifying waves had finally sailed slowly into a tranquil harbor.</seg>
<seg id="24"> A young and fragile heart had finally been gingerly placed back into its original position after weathering through near insane havoc.</seg>
<seg id="25"> Oh this earth, my homeland, you have finally let us feel the warmth and endearment of home once again!</seg>
<seg id="26"> A sense of blissfulness after surviving a calamity filled me up like a warm current from the bottom of my feet to my entire body.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Facing what was once a cordial and warm youth section courtyard which had now become a wasteland of rubbles, Yu Doudou, who had just passed the age of 17, steadied herself and suddenly burst out crying.</seg>
<seg id="28"> Everyone was infected and hot tears flowed all over.</seg>
<seg id="29"> Snow started to drop from the sky, was it condolence fluttering down for the misfortune of mankind?</seg>
<seg id="30"> That year, the Haicheng earthquake took away as many as 1,000 lives.</seg>
<seg id="31"> Experts said: Thanks to the timely prediction, and the fact that it occurred at a time when people were not asleep, otherwise a strong earthquake measuring 7.3 magnitudes would have taken at least the lives of 100,000 people!</seg>
<seg id="32"> Merely a year apart, the Tangshan earthquake erupted, and over 200,000 people died.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Those Matters in the Village</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> There are many families in the village, among them is a Nan family that is the most detestable.  There is a well-known remark circulating in the village: Beware of fire, beware of theft and beware of the Nans.</seg>
<seg id="3"> In fact the whole family of Nan is still rather honest in comparison.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Some families will steal a melon or something from the land of others on normal days, and the members of the Nan family are just committing petty theft, and the Nans need not be isolated to the extent by everyone in the whole village.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Everyone is not clean, who has been offended by members of my Nan family?</seg>
<seg id="6"> The Nan family started organizing some very prestigious activities to show that this village was built initially by the ancestors of the Nan family and that the Nan family has always been a major family growing grains.  In addition it has fostered some well-known individuals in history as well as contributed significantly to the building of this village.</seg>
<seg id="7"> At the same time, the members of the Nan family have intimately invited the cadres of the village to their home to take a look and have a seat.</seg>
<seg id="8"> In short, the members of the Nan family are very diligent, wanting to fight a proactive battle and striving to be powerful.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Not long ago, the Xi family did a very disgraceful thing, carrying out brutal persecution towards the seedlings of the Nan family.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The Xi family depends on matchmaking for their fame in the village, and all the young men in the village have benefited from the Xi family.</seg>
<seg id="11"> If it hadn't been for the good matchmaking done by the Xi family, how would all these families and households have been able to produce so well!</seg>
<seg id="12"> However this time round, the Xi family actually used black bricks to crush the seedlings of the Nan family at a place called Hong Dong.  It was utterly despicable, and the whole village was infuriated, all remarking that there is no good person in the Xi family.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The Nan family demanded an explanation from the Xi family, arousing the sympathy from everyone in the whole village.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Everyone in the village spitted in the direction of the Xi family.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Hence, the battleground was relocated to the Xi family.</seg>
<seg id="16"> The Nan family is determined to create a good image prior to the 17th village meeting and let this most flourishing Nan family prosper.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Though the cadres of the village have daily advised everyone to live in harmony, this village called Zhong is never peaceful.</seg>
<seg id="18"> The most repugnant thing is that in the short period of two to three months, even the pigs have started to clamor for revolt, demanding for a rise of their own value!</seg>
<seg id="19"> Two years ago, when chickens suffered from flu in various villages, weren't they all killed?</seg>
<seg id="20"> Why don't you pigs have no brains?</seg>
<seg id="21"> You can clamor for revolution, but you can't escape from being beheaded!</seg>
<seg id="22"> And Mei Village and Ying Village which are used to bullying people may not seem to be peaceful either, even though their days are well-off.</seg>
<seg id="23"> There were some vagrants, knocking down tall buildings in Mei Village today, and throwing some small explosive cans to the subway of Ying Village tomorrow, that is scary enough to people, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="24"> Therefore, the people of Zhong Village generally feel that though it is disgusting not to be able to afford houses, treat their illnesses, or go to school, being able to peacefully do some farming, take on some work, and build up some relationship can be also considered stepping into the new era.</seg>
<seg id="25"> The Nan family, and the Xi family, ah, which family doesn't have their own undisclosed dilemmas?</seg>
<seg id="26"> Take for example members of the Wan family residing at a little bend in the southeastern part of the village.  Though the head of this household is a little shameless, isn't it that our great Zhong Village still shelters this family just the same?</seg>
<seg id="27"> With the 2008 All Village Sports Meet to be held in our Zhong Village soon, save some energy on those trivial matters in the village and reform those delinquent children in the village.</seg>
<seg id="28"> All families and households, light up and start the fire.  Those who have money contribute with money, and those who have strength contribute with strength.</seg>
<seg id="29"> When the time comes, everyone goes to the village town hall to watch the golden egg being laid in the bird's nest!</seg>
<seg id="30"> (Dubbing outside the picture, weakening: Golden egg or silver egg?  Dear viewers, dear viewers, this is Brother Yong, the host of the Village TV station...)</seg>

<seg id="4"> Yesterday, because I heard that the company had a special section talking about the development in China in the financial report for this quarter, and happened to hear Eric's replying to a question regarding China, which triggered considerable feelings, hence I translated it here to share this encouragement with everyone.</seg>
<seg id="5"> This speech was the reply by Google (Google) CEO Eric to the question asked by reporters during the Google Inc. Second Quarter 2007 Earnings Conference Call (Google Inc. Second Quarter 2007 Earnings Conference Call) held last week (http://investor.google.com/earnings.html), expressing extreme satisfaction over the current results achieved by Google China, and he is filled with confidence towards the future growth of Google in the China market.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Eric said that we have outstanding talent in China, with more and more perfect facilities and a product line that is constantly being enriched and localized.</seg>
<seg id="7"> He feels that though the success of Google may not be in sight, this is a very good start for Google China, and relying on the hard work of the China team, with the support of the headquarters and a never yielding spirit, he firmly believes that in the future, Google will attain amazing results in China.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Yes, the important thing is that we firmly make progress.  Because we grow up here, we have a deep sense of affection for here.  We deeply believe that Google should give China more, much more, and should give much, much more to users.</seg>

<seg id="3"> You may have known before that the T-back which has been trendy for years has already been beaten by G-String, because the latter is completely strapless.</seg>

<seg id="7"> Such slippers directly...stick to the soles of the feet: This is not a joking product, but a real product, and its selling price is US$13.5 per pair.</seg>
<seg id="8"> This is another one of those "I ever thought that it existed, but never thought that it really does exist" products, rendering people speechless.</seg>

<seg id="3"> Iljin Display, a South Korean company, has launched a laser projector module with a size of a mere coin.</seg>
<seg id="4"> As the size of the module is extremely small, such projection module can even be installed inside a cellular phone, and a projection area about 7-inch in size can be seen on the wall.</seg>
<seg id="5"> (via) A traditional projector consists of three different LCD panels, respectively responsible for emitting three different video signals of red, green and blue, while this mini type of projector only uses a single LCD panel to carry out conversion of the three colors, and this reduces the size and manufacturing costs of the projector.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Official announcement states that the LCD panel of this projector is only 0.24 inch, and can be easily integrated into a cellular phone.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Currently more than half of the cellular phones in the market have built-in cameras installed.  It is estimated that before long cellular phones with built-in projector modules will emerge in the market, but it is really very hard to say if the market will favor it.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Am Worried CCfD "Uproot Corruption Deadline" Campaign to No Avail</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> [Old Zan Skeptic] "Send Text Messages" and "Table View" submitted on 2007-07-02 at 14:41:10</seg>
<seg id="3"> On May 30, the Central Commission for Discipline set a time limit on June 30, that is, one month from now, for corrupt elements all over the country to voluntarily admit their dishonorable ways before being arrested.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Upon hearing of this, we humble people at the grassroots cannot help laughing out loud.  To catch thieves, the police issue an ultimatum asking thieves to voluntarily confess to their crimes before a deadline one month away. Or else they'll be arrested.  Can you find any anti-corruption campaign of the same pattern?</seg>
<seg id="5"> Isn't that tantamount to a clear, public announcement telling corrupt officials in advance to flee at once and to doctor the criminal evidences to avoid punishment?</seg>
<seg id="6"> What is the intention?</seg>
<seg id="7"> Isn't that .. .. sigh, what can I say!</seg>
<seg id="8"> Or, if we assume the campaign may be productive, what effect can it achieve?</seg>
<seg id="9"> Can it instill fear into the corrupt officials and deter them?</seg>
<seg id="10"> We do not rule out the possibility that some timid ones might come out and voluntarily confess. But wouldn't many many more just run away?</seg>
<seg id="11"> Let's not ask whether the deadline set by the Central Commission for Discipline will produce clear effect.  Just watch for the possible side effect in a different direction that this campaign would likely produce.</seg>
<seg id="12"> That is: the corrupt officials' gratitude toward the Central Commission for Discipline. Corrupted officials fully understand the situation and secretly feel the joy of going scotch free from any punishment.</seg>
<seg id="13"> One month would be more than enough for them to transfer and squirrel away their loot.</seg>
<seg id="14"> If I were a corrupt official, absolutely, I would also see things that way.  Definitely, neither would I go to your place and voluntarily report everything.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Corrupt officials, after reveling in joy and gratitude, will behave themselves this way.  Ha, ha. very gratefully!</seg>
<seg id="16"> Common folks are all confused. What happened to the anti-corruption campaign?  Why can't we push forward with all the powers of hurricane and thunder? Why is it so difficult to strike out resolutely?</seg>
<seg id="17"> What results can we expect from an anti-corruption campaign like this?</seg>
<seg id="18"> Honorable members of the Central Commission for Discipline, all in all, I am wary and worried over the effect your "anti-corruption deadline" will produce.</seg>

<seg id="1"> No Private Land Ownership Is Minimum Acceptable to My Calm, Rational Self</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> [Zen Buddhist Teacher Duchi] [Send Text Messages] and [Table View] posted at 10:34:39 on July 2, 2007.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Not to privatize land ownership is the last line of defense I could accept with calm and ease.</seg>
<seg id="4"> I think I am not easily angered.  At least I myself feel this way.</seg>
<seg id="5"> I have always been calm and rational when speaking on forums, I seldom lose my composure and make irrational remarks.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Also I have kept my profound faith in, and fervent expectations of the Party's Central Committee. I accept decisions the Party Central makes to push through reformation policies and measures, no matter how wide is the difference between them and my beliefs, and I consider them as one of the "characteristics".</seg>
<seg id="7"> But, once land ownership begins to be privatized (or be privatized in substance, if not in name), all the above will not hold true any more because their raison d'etre will no longer be valid.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Rather suffer the loss of a thousand troops than lose one inch of national territory.  Land is the country's greatest and most precious social resource.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The working masses and the land are the fundamental elements of a country.</seg>
<seg id="10"> As long as the nature of its land resources remain unchanged, a country will not easily change her own basic nature and attributes.  Once the land resources changed its basic nature, the change alters everything that is fundamental.</seg>
<seg id="11"> I am not a Communist Party member, but I clearly remember the following pledge I have sworn to: "Love the motherland, love the people, study diligently, improve and strengthen myself, and be ever ready to offer my strength to serve the course of Communism!"</seg>
<seg id="12"> "Study diligently, work hard, suffer the hardships at first and enjoy the fruits later.  Strive for the course of communism!"</seg>
<seg id="13"> Those who, like me, have made this pledge and sung loudly these words "We belong to the next shift in socialism," should remember what they have sworn to, if they are not wretchedly shameless.</seg>
<seg id="14"> If you have already gone back completely on your pledge, please stand up in all honesty and move yourself away from "Communism."  Don't hang on to this plaque for the purpose of hoodwinking the masses on the one hand, and on he other hand, trying hard to figure out a way of selling the plaque off at a good price.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Of course, I wish that all such concerns and worries were unnecessary, and I can keep my composure and rational behavior.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Do remember that "we belong to the next shift in socialism."</seg>
<seg id="17"> What would happen when there is no more next shift?</seg>

<seg id="1"> One Generation, Feeling of Two Ages</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Not long ago, someone brought up this question: Of 30-year-olds, are there some pro-Mao Zedong people?</seg>
<seg id="3"> Later, it was changed to 20.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The fact is: people of these age groups did not live through the Mao Zedong era. Those who asked this question either have poured water into their brains, or are afflicted with inherent dementia.</seg>
<seg id="5"> In the city, the most qualified spokespersons of the Mao Zedong era should be those who lived through these years in person and suffered all the miseries of that era, in other words, people born between 1950 and 1960.</seg>
<seg id="6"> After they were born, their parents plunged into political movements, thus failing to provide the children love and care corresponding to their needs.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Just when they needed proper nutrition, natural disasters arose and lasted for three years.  The children suffered much of the pains of hunger.</seg>
<seg id="8"> When starting school, they met head on with the Cultural Revolution that wiped out opportunities of schooling for many years.</seg>
<seg id="9"> For some, it even cut short their schooling for life.  At 15 to 17, their schooling still had a long way to go.  But they had to abandon their study in order to answer the call of the Party to "climb the mountains, go to the countryside and support the constructions on the frontier."</seg>
<seg id="10"> After starting their work, they were proud to become members of the worker class and volunteered for the heaviest and most exhausting jobs.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Glory for that moment, but misery for the whole life.</seg>
<seg id="12"> When it was time for them to get married, late marriage, late child-bearing and the one-family-one-baby policy also started from them.</seg>
<seg id="13"> When their pay was due to be raised, businesses started to put more value on school diplomas.  And their chance for a raise was crushed because they had no diploma.</seg>
<seg id="14"> After they worked hard to bring up the offspring, paid for its basic education and saw the child passing a university entrance examination, there was the reforms of the education system and the state-owned enterprises, college tuition went up and they lost their jobs.</seg>
<seg id="15"> As they got old day after day, illness and disease began to take a toll on their health.  Unfortunately, this also coincided with the change and reform in the nation's healthcare system. This means: illness could not be treated since they could not afford to pay the medical and hospital bills.</seg>
<seg id="16"> It is obvious that a total lack of social justice ruthlessly descended on this generation.</seg>
<seg id="17"> But among people of this generation, not so many have joined the camp opposing Maoism or attacking Mao Zedong.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Why?</seg>
<seg id="19"> They are not Mao's slaves, but men of flesh and blood who constitute the real and living groups of humanity in our society. Through their life of climbing the mountains and going to the countryside down to the loss of their jobs, these people lived and experienced in person our history and that is the social phenomenon of two historical eras.</seg>
<seg id="20"> In spite of the school closing, the deplorable shortage of food and clothing and numerous other ills of the society in the Mao Zedong age, which aroused their grumbling and even hatred, they still consider the Mao Zedong years as good and as a time of high nationalism, superior ethical and moral life and of unsurpassed social environment and traditions.</seg>
<seg id="21"> Parents of some of our friends on the internet belong to this age group.  You might do well to have a chat with them.</seg>

<seg id="1"> "Injection for Watermelons," "Cancerous Bananas," and "Cardboard-Filled Buns"</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> [Barren Plain beyond Northern Borders] [Send Text Messages] and [Table View] posted at 22:02:57 on July 19, 2007.  I remember a news item of the year before last reporting that chemicals were injected into Hainan watermelons, resulting in the melons rotting on a massive scale in the fields and enormous losses to the melon growers.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Later, CCTV followed up with reports that thorough investigation proved there was absolutely no such a thing.</seg>
<seg id="4"> That report sounded strange in the first place. For injecting something into big watermelons one after another lacks any practical and meaningful justification. And, considering the amount of work, it would prove an impossible task.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Memories of things happening last year are much clearer.  Media reports said banana plants in Hainan were infested with a disease similar to cancer that afflicts people. Such diseased banana plants could hardly survive.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Consequently, many people were misled to conclude that consuming bananas leads to cancer. The end result is the same: banana price collapsed; and, lamenting out loud, banana farmers cried and cried even after all tears were exhausted.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The reason that the two above reports were so sensational lies in the fact that they directly touched people's most sensitive nerve cords, namely, the issue of food safety.</seg>
<seg id="8"> If public media reported that certain foods are detrimental to health, the report is bound to spread far and wide from one person to ten and from ten to one hundred. As to the truth and substance of the report, people generally would rather take them seriously as credible than brush them aside as not trust-worthy. To one individual consumer, skipping a few Hainan watermelons and/or bananas from his diet is, after all, only a bagatelle.  But to the grower and wholesaler of the produce, it is immeasurably important.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Not long ago, a case of unsafe food exploded on the Beijing media scene. As pork price increased steeply, some people used treated cardboard paper as filling to make steamed buns for sale. This was the so-called "buns of cardboard filling."</seg>
<seg id="10"> I was roundly shocked upon hearing this report. I felt that these small hawkers are too good at their R&D work that they devised such a method to cheat the consumers. Furthermore, I spread the news far and wide and warned my families and friends not to buy steamed buns when they go on the street.</seg>
<seg id="11"> But yesterday, again reports suddenly sprang up to say that the story of "buns of cardboard filling" was a fake.  And the whole thing was fabricated by one person. Thereupon I felt relieved and at ease. But, at the same time, I also began to wonder: What exactly is ailing our media today?</seg>
<seg id="12"> The true story I got from reliable sources runs like this: Mr. Zi, a temporary staff member on "Transparency," a program on the lifestyle channel of the Beijing Television Station, purchased ground meat filling, wheat flour and paper cartons on the market and arranged for some people, one of them named Wei, to use the meat and the cardboard paper, after pulping the latter in water, to make steamed buns.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Zi stage-managed and filmed the bun-making process with digital video equipment he himself brought along, edited the film and got it on the TV program by hook or by crook.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Now public security authorities have detained suspect Zi, and will deal with him in a stern manner in accordance with the law.</seg>
<seg id="15"> After the cardboard bun story broke into the open, concerned and responsible offices and departments were immediately and rapidly organized by the government to look into the matter. A thoroughgoing and all-embracing inspection in the breakfast foods market in Beijing was conducted in order to ensure the safety on the dining tables of the common folks.</seg>
<seg id="16"> After the truth behind the incident was firmly established, the Beijing Television Station learned a deeply ingrained lesson and tendered open apologies to the public at large.  It also sternly investigated and dealt with the responsible people and will further improve management and control in order to stop up loopholes and block false, distorted and fabricated news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Only, although the cardboard buns are proven to be non-existent, when public confidence will be restored so that people would again go to street stalls to buy steamed buns without fear remains a question mark.</seg>
<seg id="18"> The whole thing also shows, incidentally, that the government has assigned top priority and taken immediate and rapid action to solve problems related to food safety issues. It also demonstrated with considerable clarity that the dining tables in Beijing homes are still relatively safe.  While the cardboard buns scare turned out to be a false alarm, it also could be considered a reminder and admonition to the public at large.</seg>

<seg id="1"> To Whom Should Education be Responsible?</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Recently, I heard friends in China talk about what they sew at a school.  I cannot help speaking out about some of my concerns.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The incident occurred in a private high school in the city of Shanghai, the Southwest Weiyu Middle School.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The school decided to assign its best teachers to three classes  comprising students who signed a contract to move up inside Southwest Weiyu from middle school to high school. To other classes whose students consist of those transferred to Weiyu from outside and/or those who signed no contract to move up inside Weiyu, several young teachers whose pedagogic track record was not good and who had no experience teaching the third high school grade.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The reason is: those students who signed the agreement agreed to give up chances to take entrance examinations to other high schools, so best teachers should be given according to the assurances agreed and promised.</seg>
<seg id="6"> As to the students in several other classes, the school expressed this attitude: Young teachers should be given opportunities to improve themselves through practice.</seg>
<seg id="7"> I just cannot help lamenting, to whom is education responsible?</seg>
<seg id="8"> I remember that many years ago, when I attended a key high school, our whole class, dissatisfied with the pedagogic performance of a math teacher, boldly, perhaps even recklessly, signed a joint petition, asking that the teacher be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Afterwards, school authorities did replace the teacher. For the school promised that all individual students are considered equal and the school is responsible to every one of them.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Ten years ago, I came to the United States to pursue post-graduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="11"> One year, in the summer, we were choosing what courses to take in the fall. I found that our department offered, in electives, all theoretical courses, but not one application-oriented practical course.</seg>
<seg id="12"> I went to talk to the department chair, telling him that there is a problem with the curriculum.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The department chair admitted that the lack of application-oriented courses was due to insufficient faculty strength.  After a couple of years when there is available faculty, such courses may become available.</seg>
<seg id="14"> I remember telling him then: "This is your problem, not mine."</seg>
<seg id="15"> From Shanghai, I traveled thousands of miles to come to study in your esteemed school, precisely because I was attracted by your brochure introducing me to the courses you offered.</seg>
<seg id="16"> If you were unable to offer these courses, then, refrain from putting them on the brochure.  Otherwise, it would be false advertisement, not accountable to me and to my family.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Having heard my opinion, the department chair thought for a while and said: "OK, let me see what we can do to solve the problem."</seg>
<seg id="18"> Maybe it was too late, because all courses were already offered for online registration.</seg>
<seg id="19"> After three weeks, the department chair called me in for a talk, telling me mainly that his job was to assume responsibility to all and every student, including me.</seg>
<seg id="20"> He accepted my suggestion and did his best, that was to add two strongly application-oriented practical courses. He hoped that I could understand.</seg>
<seg id="21"> After this happened, I took several courses taught by the department chair.</seg>
<seg id="22"> He never harbored any prejudice against me for the views I expressed.  In every course I took, he very impartially gave me an A.</seg>
<seg id="23"> Before my graduation, I heard his secretary's remarks on how he did his very best for all his students, but not every one of them were grateful.</seg>
<seg id="24"> At the commencement ceremony, when speaking as the valedictorian, I told the department chair that every one thanks him from the bottom of our hearts for all he did to help us. For he did his best to assume responsibility to every one of us.</seg>
<seg id="25"> I felt that I made a correct choice of my life to come here and study.</seg>
<seg id="26"> When uttering these words, I saw tears the department chair tried to hide in his eyes.  One day, if every Chinese educator and the whole education system dedicate themselves to be responsible to every student, I think, the real take-off point of the nation will not be too far ahead.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Central NY Men's 4s Volleyball Tournament</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Last Sunday, I took part in the men's 4s volleyball tournament in the central New York state. Spending six and a half hours playing the matches, our team finally won the championship.</seg>
<seg id="3"> This tournament, in fact, was organized as a training session to prepare for the volleyball tournament of the Empire State Games.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The coach broke up four men's teams (high school and college teams plus teams of 35-year-old-and-over as well as 45-year-old-and-over players) from the central regions of New York, then reorganized the players into teams of four members each. Every team was assigned one middle blocker/setter to proceed with the matches.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The rules of the tournament were quite interesting. Only players in the rear row were permitted to go on the offensive and the ball must not drop into the 3-meter zone.  Only one player, the middle blocker, was allowed to go to the net to block the opponent's offensive.  No position rotation among a team's players was permitted.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Hence, it was basically a test of the power of the offense and the positioning of the defense.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Our team had a setter, who was two meters in height.  His attack was at once powerful and from a high vantage point. In the whole match, he was responsible for more than 60% of the offensive action and scoring.  We also had one 1.85-meter middle blocker who single-handedly frustrated many enemy offensive actions on the net,</seg>
<seg id="8"> and a 1.9-meter wing spiker who made many mistakes in his offensive action for he was positioned in the rear.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Then there was me, a 1.75-meter ace spiker who often sneaked up for a surprise attack. My scoring ratio was fair.  I was mainly responsible for catching crosscourt smashes from the other side.</seg>
<seg id="10"> There were altogether seven teams.  They started with a round-robin in which our team won the first match.  Then, the referee repeatedly called our foul for our setter's stepping on the line when staging an offensive.  Our morale was thus greatly depressed, leading to the loss of three matches in a row.</seg>
<seg id="11"> But after the loss, we all regained our poise and our coordination stabilized during these three matches. Then, we began to win one match after another.</seg>
<seg id="12"> At the end of the round-robin, our team won three and lost three matches to rank ourselves a sixth.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Following that, supplementary matches began.  Without the top-ranking team, the second to seventh teams competed one against another in a game of elimination.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Our team stayed calm and stable psychologically and in tactics. We worked hard to overwhelm our opponents and led the field in qualifying for the semi-finals.</seg>
<seg id="15"> In the semi-final matches, the opponent has a strong offense and weak defense. They afflicted blue and purple bruises on my arms. But, once safely catching a hard spike, I got out of it a kick that was twice as satisfactory as my own successful offensive action.</seg>
<seg id="16"> We were not even aware of the final score when we won the game.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Our opponent in the final match had a balanced offense-defense. We won many points by our serve and lead the game all the way.</seg>
<seg id="18"> At the very end, we were comfortably leading with 21 to 24.  Then, two powerful serves in a row by the opponent flew wild after I touched them. The score: 23 to 24.  The setter of our team ran over and told me: Nothing to be concerned, it's only a couple of points.</seg>
<seg id="19"> Then, another ball was flying in my direction. Not too bad, I received it safe and sound. Then, our middle blocker passed it backward to the setter to bring about a smashing spike and the battle was over.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Again on Morality</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Much has been said about morality as it bears on the free and unattached individual.</seg>
<seg id="3"> In this regard, I have nothing more to add.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Now, I wish to address myself to the question of morality for the collective entity.</seg>
<seg id="5"> We often see the occasion when collective life and activities are essential.</seg>
<seg id="6"> On such an occasion, a collective body needs to maintain certain moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="7"> We can often find that collective entities which achieved success can boast of their virtues and morality.</seg>
<seg id="8"> That does not come about by chance.</seg>
<seg id="9"> For the causes or activities, one needs to overcome the difficulties confronting it, and its constituencies need to close ranks. I think, high moral strength, besides faith and creed, plays a vital role that cannot be neglected.</seg>
<seg id="10"> At the very least, we can safely predict that a group of people of low moral standards will not succeed in any worthy task.</seg>
<seg id="11"> This might because that, for a collective entity to achieve success, an essential quality is the wisdom that sees long-term interest through rational far-sightedness.</seg>
<seg id="12"> In fact, a collective entity often establishes its identity through a wide variety of ways such as logos, trade jargon, creed, and morality.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Only by taking brandy in the morning and in the evening, can we see the ground blanketed by orchid flowers all along the Road of Life.</seg>

<seg id="1"> [Discussion] Up to Now, How Many Times True Happiness Occurred?</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A very close high school friend of mine finally obtained a visa.  At the end of August she will be able to start her journey to pursue graduate studies in an extremely good college on the west coast of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Today, several school friends had a small get-together.  All were so happy to see her dreams come true.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Seeing her so happy, I felt really envious.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Think of all the years up to the present, I was that happy only when I passed the entrance examination to high school.  Up to that time, I never dreamed that I could succeed in the examination to enter the top or second ranking school in the entire city.  Afterwards, between then and now came college and workplace which followed in due course and never gave me the same joy again.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The university I was admitted to was not the one I dreamed of entering.  Hence, not much pleasure to speak of.</seg>
<seg id="7"> In the college years, all my hopes lie in the possibility of going north after graduation so that I could join my boyfriend, with whom I fell in love for two years then.</seg>
<seg id="8"> But fate plays games with you!  One month before my graduation, he asked that we go our separate ways. All the dreams I cherished up to that moment exploded like a bubble.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Afterwards, I returned to the north to take a job. Today, I have been on the job for two years and have built up enough savings to buy a medium-priced car. But throughout it all, I have not experienced again the happiness that once did descend on me.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Today, when chatting with my good friend, I can understand and feel her happiness.  After struggling gallantly and working with a tremulous heart for one year to prepare herself, she finally goes abroad without a hitch to start a period of new life.  To experience a dream coming true really makes one happy.</seg>
<seg id="11"> I have no plans to pursue further studies and do not like living in a foreign country. For I had worked for half a year abroad which led me to believe that living abroad does not suit me.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Witness the happiness of a good friend cannot help leading me to think: what am I pursuing?</seg>
<seg id="13"> What will be able to make me experience, once again, the happiness of yore?</seg>
<seg id="14"> Possibly, it is to find someone who truly likes me and wishes to live with me through the second half of our lives.</seg>
<seg id="15"> I think I will then cry out emotionally, just like what my good friend described to me of her uncontrollable burst into tears when she sailed through the embassy interview and received the approval notice.  One year of work and worries finally brought the reward.</seg>
<seg id="16"> But, what about me?</seg>
<seg id="17"> Time and again I did my best to manage, with a tremulous heart, my emotional life.  When will I be rewarded with the realization of my dreams and cry out once to my heart's content and delight?</seg>
<seg id="18"> Perhaps I do not have much ambition, for I never, from the beginning to the end, worry about my career. But, what about my emotional life?</seg>
<seg id="19"> When will I find an emotional home?</seg>
<seg id="20"> I am very distressed when dealing with this problem.</seg>
<seg id="21"> What about you, my brothers and sisters?</seg>
<seg id="22"> Up to this moment, how many times have you encountered genuine happiness in your life?</seg>

<seg id="1"> Promote Architecture College of Southeast University</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Ah, ah, count the following as my briefing for the Southeast University alumni on the College of Architecture of their University.</seg>
<seg id="3"> I am presenting the most recent first-hand information. Authenticity is guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Dean Wang, Party Secretary An, teacher Li of the Personnel Office and other faculty members of the Pedagogic and Research Section of Architectural Technology attended the briefing and reporting session. I talked for an hour followed by discussions by all participants for another one and a half hours.</seg>
<seg id="5"> After the formal reporting session ended, teacher Zhang (Assistant to the Dean) pulled me aside and asked me to a closed-door talk with him in an office to the rear of the compound.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Very friendly and approachable he told me behind closed doors that some things could not be discussed at a formal meeting. He said it was obvious that I did not have any idea on my income here in the future. Hence, he told me some concrete cases of earnings and income of faculty members of the College of Architecture, to ease my anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Before the formal reporting session, Dean Wang gave an introduction to the Colleges of Architecture. He said that only six important architecture disciplines were offered in all institutions throughout the country, namely, two in Southeast University, two in Tsinghua, one in Tongji and one in Tianjin University.  None is offered anywhere else.</seg>
<seg id="8"> He said in recent years, energy saving of architectures, green architecture and architectural technology have gained special attention in the nation. Southeast University wanted to bring in a faculty member specialized in these fields.</seg>
<seg id="9"> He said they received resumes from more than 20 applicants for this job. They were from domestic sources, Japan and the United States (I was the sole applicant from the U.S., it seems).</seg>
<seg id="10"> The College of Architecture considered the matter vital and conducted serious investigations on the applicants.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Compared to the architecture colleges of other higher educational institutions that I know, Southeast University certainly is a front runner.  While Tongji University may be placed much higher than Eastern in city planning, the latter is likely a bit better in architectural design. (I did not know that then.)</seg>
<seg id="12"> The College of Architecture has been designated one of the colleges vital to the National 985 Engineering Construction Plan.  In the past two years, it has been very well provided financially, said Dean Wang.</seg>
<seg id="13"> He told me that Southeast University was allocated, at one throw, ten million yuan of development and construction financing last year.  Of this amount, 3.5 million was to be used directly to replenish the specialist technological library of the College.  (Wow, to this, I must sing a song of praise: What generosity!)</seg>
<seg id="14"> The remainder is nearly all used on installation and equipment of the specialist laboratory that I proposed.</seg>
<seg id="15"> It is said that to this project several academicians expressed variant views.</seg>
<seg id="16"> ha, ha -- while on the subject, I might as well say that I think they paid too much for some imported equipments.</seg>
<seg id="17"> One set of equipment to conduct experiments to measure air-tightness of a room is widely used in the United States where its cost is definitely below 500 US dollars. Southeast University finally spent RMB 50,000 to acquire it.</seg>
<seg id="18"> There are yet other situations worth reporting, many departments and colleges of the Southeast University have moved to the new campus in Jiulonghu. But the College of Architecture has made a firm decision to stay put, professing that its student should remain in a superior architectural environment. There are still some architectural classics on the old campus grounds, while the new campus is completely barren of them.</seg>
<seg id="19"> ha ha - It seems that since other departments have moved away, the College of Architecture requisitioned an additional building.</seg>
<seg id="20"> Hence, Dean Wang told me right off that an exclusive office could be assigned me later on.</seg>
<seg id="21"> It caused me some embarrassment later for this offer made by Dean Wang did not arouse any emotional reaction in me when it was received.</seg>
<seg id="22"> Afterwards, I was told by teacher Zhang, who pulled me aside, that this offer did not come easy. For office space was in real short supply and some senior professors had not been assigned their own yet.</seg>
<seg id="23"> This made me extremely uneasy.  It seemed that I had very little idea of the background of the situation in this country.</seg>
<seg id="24"> All in all, this trip to Southeast University is very pleasant for me. I am highly and favorably impressed by the dedication, enthusiasm and friendship of the leadership and responsible faculty members of the College of Architecture of the University.</seg>
<seg id="25"> I wish Southeast University will sail smoothly and rapidly forward on the road of development, and its College of Architecture will maintain a good lead ahead of its sister institutions!</seg>

<seg id="2"> Taking Care of Sick Children</seg>
<seg id="3"> Showing "Muscles of Mice"</seg>
<seg id="4"> After Congo, Sun Yanzi joined the World Outlook Conference for the second time to travel to Niger, Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5"> At a press conference yesterday, she admitted frankly that it was the most exhausting trip she had ever undertaken in her life.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The local weather was extremely hot and the drinking water was muddy.  When visiting the city market she was met by crowds throwing stones in protest.  Even when she rode a camel its saddle chair left a scratch wound on her.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Dozens of incidents happened along the way, causing her to cry out loud repeatedly in her mind: "How I wish to go back home!"</seg>
<seg id="8"> She was shocked seeing malnutrition in children.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Having joined the "Care for the Impoverished Children" campaign of the World Outlook Conference three years in a row, Sun Yanzi calls herself a senior spokesperson of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="10"> She has brought along 30 bottles of vitamins, 40 flashlights and 500 pieces of candy to share with the local children.</seg>
<seg id="11"> She said, accumulated experiences told her no matter what quantities of small gifts one brings along they will never prove to be enough.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The most serious problem encountered in Niger is that the mothers there know absolutely nothing about bringing up their children and the children suffer from serious malnutrition problems.</seg>
<seg id="13"> When on an 8-hour, 500-kilometer journey from the capital city of Niger to the small town of Tawa, Sun Yanzi experienced a sandstorm which is rare in that area.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Stormy winds carried sand mixed with rain water.  The entire sky changed color with the turbulence of the storm.</seg>
<seg id="15"> The jeep she was riding in swung wildly with the winds.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Recalling that time, Sun Yanzi is still trembling with fear left over from that day.  Though she was inside the car, she still could not help feeling scared.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Afterwards, only when she heard indigenous folks say that sandstorms symbolize good fortune, she felt somewhat relieved.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Together with Local People</seg>
<seg id="19"> Lamenting Difficulties Plaguing Local Mothers in Rearing Children</seg>
<seg id="20"> Upon her arrival in Tawa, local officials staged a welcome ceremony which featured single hump camels. Sun Yanzi was invited to mount a camel to acknowledge the loud applause and salute of the local welcoming crowds.</seg>
<seg id="21"> But the camel, scared by photographers' flashes, went out of control.  Sun Yanzi was almost thrown down to the ground.</seg>
<seg id="22"> Finally, she herself dismounted. But her dress was caught and torn by the saddle, leaving a bloodied scratch of some 8 centimeters on her back.</seg>
<seg id="23"> On this visit, Sun Yanzi visited four sick local children who suffered from serious malnutrition.  One of them was a baby four months of age weighing only 2.1 kilograms.  It did not look like a human baby at all.</seg>
<seg id="24"> Sun said: "My heart aches when I saw the baby whose condition was really grotesque. But the mother should be responsible. Mothers there should be taught the right ideas and ways of nutrition for their children."</seg>

<seg id="2"> Key terms: Key to Education in China -- Humanistic Orientation   Key to Education in China -- Humanistic Orientation</seg>
<seg id="3"> The purpose of education is: to make the educated capable of existing  and of enjoying themselves in the present social environment with greater ease.</seg>
<seg id="4"> "Existing" -- This is a concept easily understood by all. As to "enjoyment," people perhaps understand it to be simply "play and entertainment."  In fact, it is not so.  "Enjoyment" signifies many categories of concepts and events.</seg>
<seg id="5"> "Existing" includes growth and strengthening of physical and mental capabilities.</seg>
<seg id="6"> 1. Growth and strengthening of one's physical capabilities -- Through sports, one can enhance physical power, ability of coordination, and constantly improve mobility to satisfy one's own need of moving about as well as the social need of dealing with the society.</seg>
<seg id="7"> 2. Growth and strengthening of one's mental capabilities -- One can achieve clearer understanding of the society one lives in, as well as knowledge of the self. One learns to master ways of dealing with other people, and  acquires the skills of adapting to one's existence, and of enjoying life.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The above is a discussion of the purpose of education which does not really bear on the theme of this writing.  Now, let's talk about the point of emphasis: Key to Education in China -- Humanistic Orientation.</seg>

<seg id="1"> [Original Article of the Club]: Usual Stages of Learning Buffett</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Original Article of the Club: Usual Stages of Learning Buffett</seg>
<seg id="3"> 1) The first stage: First contact with Buffett rewards one with the feeling of pocketing a sovereign treasure. Immediate application of what one learned follows. However, at this point of time, superficial and half-baked knowledge frequently leads to wrong approaches, incorrect application and blind alleys. Good harvest may appear today and disappear tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id="4"> 2) The second stage: A "breakthrough" of Buffett theory. After a period of intensive study, both in theory and in practice, almost every "wise man" would try to puzzle out a number of questions, such as "What is a Buffett of special Chinese characteristics?"</seg>
<seg id="5"> or "Do we have to be flexible in applying the Buffett theory in China?"</seg>
<seg id="6"> or "Can we do better than Buffett can?"</seg>
<seg id="7"> Thus, during this stage of learning, the student is mainly affected by a blind megalomania in a search for a Buffett theory with a China bent.</seg>
<seg id="8"> After a period of practice in the real world, success still often proves to be an elusive matter, void of consistency and continuity. If one is lucky, he would do his best to take some losses and reverse his course as early as possible.</seg>
<seg id="9"> 3) The third stage: Returning to Buffett.  After turning things upside down a number of times, one finally realizes that one is only an ordinary person instead of a genius.</seg>
<seg id="10"> One should lower expectations of oneself.  Modestly, one should be satisfied completely with just learning from Buffett.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Contrary to common belief, the simplest is the most useful and most effective.  But simple methods usually are based on extremely profound theories.  Understanding such profound theories must precede better and full prosecution of the simple methods.</seg>
<seg id="12"> What this stage brings forward is: modest success in the short term, but plenty of long-term rewards and continuity.</seg>
<seg id="13"> 4) The fourth stage: "stubborn" Buffett.  After tasting continuity of successes, one becomes basically a stubborn hard-line believer in Buffett theories.  One would not honor a company that is not of the Buffett mould even with a condescending glance.</seg>
<seg id="14"> One studies Buffett theories incessantly to enhance one's understanding and apply them in practice. One's performance in this stage would bring ever better results, and usher one into a cycle of positives.</seg>
<seg id="15"> How long each stage lasts would depend on the nature and condition of the individual and his or her luck and fortune.</seg>

<seg id="2"> He is my online friend of long standing.  He posted the following story in the newsgroup.</seg>
<seg id="3"> I would rather write the story in this column.</seg>
<seg id="4"> I hope you all can read the article, though I do not expect it to become a so-called recommended article. Nevertheless, I believe some things and truths can often be better grasped by way of a small but tightly organized story.</seg>
<seg id="5"> This is a story that makes the readers feel as if a chill is running through the heart.</seg>
<seg id="6"> I really wish that it were only a story, for such a real-world event would make one feel very sad and distressed.</seg>
<seg id="7"> On a highway running through mountainous terrain, three gun-wielding bandits, having spotted a pretty woman driver on a medium-sized bus, forced the vehicle to a stop, and invited the driver off the bus for a little stroll.  In despair, she called out for help. But all the passengers responded with utter silence.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The only prompt response came from a middle-aged man of flimsy build. He was, however, knocked down to the floor, wounded.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Trembling in anger, he tried hard, rose again and shouted for help from all the fellow passengers. However, none responded. That allowed the bandits to drag the woman driver away to the bushes in the forest.</seg>
<seg id="10"> An hour later, the three bandits came back to the bus along with the driver, whose clothing was badly rumbled and torn.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The bus was to be under way again.  The woman driver asked the skinny and bleeding man who was beaten up to get off the bus.</seg>
<seg id="12"> He refused and things got into a deadlock.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Hey, get off the bus. My bus will not carry you.</seg>
<seg id="14"> The middle-aged man fumed: You are out of your senses.  Did I do something wrong in trying to help you?</seg>
<seg id="15"> You? Trying to help me?</seg>
<seg id="16"> What help have you given?</seg>
<seg id="17"> The woman driver's persistent denials caused some of the fellow passengers to giggle, quite inaudibly.</seg>
<seg id="18"> The middle-aged man was furious. He hated himself for not possessing the prowess of a Robin Hood.</seg>
<seg id="19"> Even if I failed to save people out of dangerous straits, do I deserve to be shooed out of the bus?  He firmly refused to evacuate.</seg>
<seg id="20"> Besides, I paid the fare and have the right to ride in the bus!</seg>
<seg id="21"> The driver raised her sight, looking skyward, and said without mercy: If you do not get off, I am not going to drive.</seg>
<seg id="22"> Quite unexpectedly, the fellow passengers who closed their eyes when witnessing the brutal crime just a while earlier, were now suddenly awakened. They tried as one to persuade the middle-aged man to leave the bus. Get off real quick. We still have our business to do, and cannot afford the delay!</seg>
<seg id="23"> Several strong passengers even wanted to pull the middle-aged man off the bus. That reminds one of scenes in "Boule De Suif" by Maupassant.</seg>
<seg id="24"> The three bandits grinned smugly.</seg>
<seg id="25"> Of the three, a dark-skinned one shamelessly said: We made her reckless!</seg>
<seg id="26"> The other two also were delirious: she is mine, she is none of your business!</seg>
<seg id="27"> A fight and pushing followed until the skinny man's baggage was thrown out of the window and he himself was shoved out of the vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="28"> The bus was again under way on the highway in the mountains.  The female driver pushed back her hair and turned the radio-recorder on.</seg>
<seg id="29"> The bus was approaching the summit. After negotiating a turn, the driver saw the slope downward looming large ahead. On the left was mountain side, to the right was a steep cliff hundreds of meters deep.</seg>
<seg id="30"> Quietly and imperceptibly, the vehicle picked up speed.  Facial expression of the woman driver was perfectly calm.  Her two hands gripped the steering wheel firmly.  Gleaming tears were streaming down her cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="31"> One bandit seemed to have sensed something wrong. He said, drive slowly! Slow down! God damn it! What are you trying to do?</seg>
<seg id="32"> The woman driver said nothing. The bus continued to go faster and faster.</seg>
<seg id="33"> The bandit tried to dash forward to grab the steering wheel. But the bus was shooting off the cliff like an arrow released from the bow.</seg>
<seg id="34"> On the next day, local newspapers reported a tragedy that happened yesterday in the Mount Fuhu area: a medium-sized bus plunged down the high cliffs.</seg>
<seg id="35"> Of all 14 persons on board -- the driver and 13 passengers -- none survived the accident.</seg>
<seg id="36"> Upon reading the report, the middle-aged man who was forced out of the bus mid-way in the journey, cried out.</seg>
<seg id="37"> Nobody knew for what and why was he crying.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Darkness in Railway Station</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> I have been traveling by train out of town in the recent days and have discovered how "black" the railroad stations in various places are!</seg>
<seg id="3"> I want to find out what precautions one should take in rail stations in various localities.</seg>
<seg id="4"> I'm from Changsha, and let me start with a description of the ins and outs of Changsha. Pay attention if you're going to Changsha!</seg>
<seg id="5"> 1. Train tickets always in short supply: Especially in the long holidays, and on dates associated with the start and end of summer and winter vacations or opening and closure of school semesters, the scarcity is absolute. No matter how early you go to line up at the ticket counter, your efforts and sacrifices would prove to be in vain.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The most water-tight answer I can find is: all tickets have been reserved for and by travel agencies.</seg>
<seg id="7"> But, from the ticket scalpers, you can get as many as you want at a premium.</seg>
<seg id="8"> 2. Watch out for forgeries: Even the supply by the scalpers is not always the genuine article. In Hunan, a man becomes rich by forging official certificates and licenses in Shuangfeng, and another fellow by counterfeiting banknotes and coins in Xinhua. Hence, producing forged tickets is merely child's play.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Forgery by way of cutting and patching up is of the crudest sort. Some forged tickets look so authentic and even the train staff cannot identify them!</seg>
<seg id="10"> 3. Who touched my banknote:  Be very careful when shopping at the stores in the rail station.</seg>
<seg id="11"> If you wish to make a payment in small-change banknotes, ah, ah, you always find their corners torn off. Consequently, you are more or less forced to convert them into notes of large denominations.</seg>
<seg id="12"> But, when you pay with a big note, the store proprietor would definitely say that he does not have enough change for you. Giving "your" note back, he, then, still asks for small notes of torn corners. Then, you have no alternative but take back the counterfeit note of a large denomination.</seg>
<seg id="13"> 4. Black magician and small change:  Not every store owner gives back "your" note which he has substituted with a counterfeit. That is a serious felony involving relatively greater risks.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Hence some "timid" store owners can only play the role of the black magician. You clearly see him counting out the correct change. But when you have a chance to do the counting yourself, ah, ah, you would find that a few notes are missing.</seg>
<seg id="15"> 5. The place is awash with imported wine and liquor.  In the tearoom of the railroad station, they do not seem to be in excessive quantity.  But you'll find out soon enough when you walk in.</seg>
<seg id="16"> A couple glasses of inferior red wine can be sold at prices rivaling that of Martell cognac.  If you refuse to pay, you may leave the place and find that your mother no longer recognizes who you are.</seg>
<seg id="17"> 6. Roses and fire arms: In the vicinity of the rail station, there are numerous video parlors which screen programs whose titles still have enormous attraction over us, the vulgar male viewers. If you step in to take a look, you will surely be taken as an honor guest seeking rest and recreation. Consequently, a rose MM appears in an instant to keep you company. Naturally, prices are comparable with that of 5-star hotels.  Otherwise, you will see that swords are not always used on the enemy!</seg>
<seg id="18"> 7. Ice and fire: If you have a Changsha accent or know the city well, you will never be able to get a taxi in front of the rail station.  The facial expressions of the taxi drivers will acquaint you with what is called "frost in June."</seg>
<seg id="19"> But, if you are a first-time visitor in Changsha, congratulations to you.  Even if the place you want to go to is only five minutes away on foot, the driver will be extra warm and solicitous in showing you the pre-eminent sceneries of this nationally designated tourism city, and to offer you, in "second-hand" fashion, a puff of the famous White Sand brand cigarettes or the characteristic local smell of betel-nuts.</seg>
<seg id="20"> Of course, you'd have to pay the taxi out of your own pocket.  Wouldn't you?</seg>

<seg id="1"> Nanjing Underground Train Driver Should Receive Psycho Treatment Soonest</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Key term: Psychotherapeutic readjustment</seg>
<seg id="3"> According to Xinhua News Agency, a man lying on the tracks of the Nanjing underground was killed in the evening of July 3.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The reporter said: "Zhu Zhengting, 22 years old, a young underground train driver, lived through a nightmare. When your reporter met him yesterday, Zhu did not seem to have regained his composure after being wrecked by the horrifying experience. Sitting on a chair, he stared straight forward, betraying signs of dementia.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Obviously, the young driver was psychologically devastated and in urgent need of immediate psychotherapeutic treatment. Without such treatment, he could expect permanent damage and life-long suffering.</seg>
<seg id="6"> I don't know if all could remember that more than 10 years ago, a man  rescued a little girl from an abandoned oil well in Texas, USA. He underwent psychotherapy for a long period of time.  But still he finally chose suicide to end his life of miseries.</seg>
<seg id="7"> At the time, he was given simple psychotherapeutic treatment. But since attention was mostly on the rescued little girl, the very person who needed even more psychotherapeutic attention was neglected.  Finally, tragic consequences became inevitable.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Similarly, in a smuggling case across the Strait of Dover several years ago, the first British policeman to open the suspect container, was reported to have blacked out right on the scene.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Later, British authorities gave him psychotherapeutic treatment for more than two months before he regained normal psychological equilibrium.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Draconian trauma caused by disasters often leaves behind severe psychological damage which can not be repaired by the individual victim alone. Such damage often would leave behind a psychological scar.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Such scars are hardly ever discernible to an outsider. And, even if discovered and identified, they often defy remedies and therapeutic treatment. Hence, many such victims are left in life-long misery and suffering.</seg>
<seg id="12"> However, in our country people show little care and concern over the suffering and victims of psychological trauma. This is especially true when we talk about family members and/or bosses and superior officers of the victims.  They often let the most crucial moments and the most opportune period for rehabilitation slip away. Then, they suddenly think about the matter only when it has become too late.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Now, since public media have diversified, we often hear a lot of such sensational reports as: many young and/or adolescent girls are abused and injured and many children witness their parents subjected to inhuman cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="14"> After these children and teenagers are rescued, it is rarely reported that they have been given psychotherapeutic treatment.  Most of them are consoled by their relatives.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Even if the victims now feel safe, their wounds eventually become scars of unrelieved pain and horror that are awakened frequently to haunt them and poison their life and behavior all the time.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Fortunately, his superiors gave the underground train driver timely help and consolation on the spot to effectively relieve and ameliorate his pressure and strains.</seg>
<seg id="17"> After all, the driver was neither at fault nor responsible at al for the accident.  He also took all needed emergency measures after discovering the dangers.  Although he could not and did not forestall the tragic accident, he did all that could have been done.</seg>
<seg id="18"> I believe, even if another eye-witness, instead of this driver, were present at the scene, he or she, likewise, would have been rudely shocked by the accident.</seg>
<seg id="19"> But other people are not involved in or responsible for the behavior of the man committing suicide.  Even if they were shocked and frightened, the shock will be gradually forgotten with the passage of time.</seg>
<seg id="20"> The driver, as someone directly involved, could not have things so easy.  He consciously and subconsciously commits the horror scene to memory, possibly for the rest of his life.</seg>
<seg id="21"> If he could be released from memories of this tragedy, that is lucky riddance of the hurtful images.  If not, horror will keep on haunting him forever.</seg>
<seg id="22"> The modern concept of good health embraces all aspects of a person's well being.  Mental health is beginning to get more attention.</seg>
<seg id="23"> It is regrettable that mental conditions of mankind in general are deplorable, particularly in urban areas.  Mental health of the human population is far from ideal.  The majority more or less has been threatened by potential mental disorders.  And others, already confronted with psycho problems, cannot stir up sufficient sympathy and concern in the mind of the public.</seg>
<seg id="24"> Just think of the lessons learned in the "Yang Lijuan incident" a while back.  Some irresponsible media, in order to arouse public interest and attention, made a target and a sacrificial lamb of a mental patient in deep psychological strain and misery.  That exerts very bad influence on the society.</seg>
<seg id="25"> We must try to prevent this sort of incident from rearing its head.  Otherwise, our society will become a sick society.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Emerging from First Round of New Curricula Training Five Dongkou Fifth High Teachers Have Much to Say</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Key terms: Dongkou Fifth High School, first group of teacher-trainees, training course for new curricula. As members of the first group taking the training course for the new curricula, five Dongkou Fifth High School teachers made a lot of comments.  From morning hours of July 13 to July 15, the first group of five Dongkou Fifth High teachers to take the training courses on the new curricula, felt the palpable pressures and driving force of the curricula.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Meanwhile, they also thought that new curricula reforms constitute a rare opportunity in and a challenge to the development of pedagogic work in schools.</seg>
<seg id="4"> In the morning of the 13th, several teachers of the Dongkou Fifth High and teachers from Suining and other places were underway. But delayed by traffic jams caused by road-building work in the Shijiang-Longhui section of the highway, we arrived at the Municipal Education Bureau late, in fact, long after 1:00 p.m.  The Bureau's staff members kept working way beyond the end of the day's shift, retrieved the materials they already loaded in a truck, did all needed paper work and distributed training materials to us.</seg>
<seg id="5"> At 2:30 p.m. the road-weary teachers again braved scorching heat to move on to the Municipal First, Municipal Second and Municipal Sixth High Schools to take part in multi-media seminars conducted by experts in various fields.</seg>
<seg id="6"> In the following two days, the teachers heard lectures either by authors and compilers of teaching materials, or by teachers from other provinces where new curricula reforms have been put into practice. The latter group talked about  their new experience and discoveries.  Some teachers and researchers of our province who went through similar training courses also shared their knowledge with us.</seg>
<seg id="7"> After all training courses were concluded in the morning of the 15th, tests and evaluation were also conducted.  The five teachers from the Dongkou Fifth High passed these tests without a hitch and received end-of-course certificates. For they all studied earnestly and never were too late in arriving or too early in quitting individual training sessions.</seg>
<seg id="8"> In the period of the training sessions, teachers from the Dongkou Fifth High exchanged views among themselves.  Not familiar with the new curricula in the beginning, all of them felt that assignments were burdensome and pressures, heavy.  They were not sure of themselves.</seg>
<seg id="9"> But after the training sessions were over, all pronounced the whole episode a worthy opportunity and challenge.</seg>
<seg id="10"> And all pledged their best effort to restructure the educational and knowledge system and to push forward the curricula reformation program to a satisfactory conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The second group of teacher-trainees to join the new curricula training program have already arrived in the relevant destinations on the 16th to take up the training courses.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Dongkou Fifth High Holds Conference on New Curricula Training to Arrange for Participation in Courses at City Education Bureau</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Key terms: Dongkou Fifth High holds conference on new curricula training, Arrange</seg>
<seg id="3"> The Dongkou Fifth High held a conference on new curricula training to arrange for participation in curricula reform training courses at the Municipal Education Bureau. At noon, 12:00, on July 5, a teachers' conference was held in the principal's office to discuss participation in the new curricula training sessions in the summer.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Principal Xie conveyed to all present the ideas and ideals of the new curricula training conference convened by the county (xian) authorities that he attended. He also talked on the significance of the new curricula reform.  Additionally, he made arrangements in regard to the participants, the time-frame, fees and expenses, as well as other pertinent matters in connection with the training sessions.</seg>
<seg id="5"> It is reported that the principal, the assistant principal and the teacher assigned to the first high school grade in the coming semester attended the training session held by Shaoyang City authorities to prepare for the new curricula reform.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Financing came from the superiors.  It was said the New China Book Store actually provided the money.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The principal and the assistant principal took part early in the general training courses. They were followed by the teacher who took various subjects in three periods.  Reporting in on July 13 in the morning at the first floor auditorium of the Municipal Education Bureau, he joined the first training period (its courses included chemistry, history and biology). Presenting his identification card, he received money as allowance for his expenses.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Subsequent training sessions started at around 8:00 in the morning and 2:30 in the afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="9"> By the end of the forenoon on the 15th, actual time spent in training sessions came to two full days.</seg>
<seg id="10"> In this period, tests were also given, and certificates were issued to qualified trainees.</seg>
<seg id="11"> History classes were held in the First Municipal High of Shaoyang City.</seg>
<seg id="12"> After coming back, the teacher-trainees were granted 60 RMB by the school to cover tuition and transportation expenses. But other travel expenditures were not reimbursed.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Glad to Befriend Fans of stars xxx</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Key terms: fans of the stars</seg>
<seg id="3"> I have a female friend whom I never met face-to-face.</seg>
<seg id="4"> I told her directly: I admire you very much.</seg>
<seg id="5"> For you express your love very directly</seg>
<seg id="6"> She likes a popular male host on an entertainment show in Taiwan and never tries to cover it up at all.</seg>
<seg id="7"> When this male host went to Jinan to host a popular program, she flew to Jinan; when he went to Changsha as a guest performer she winged there.</seg>
<seg id="8"> In a book he wrote, the male host said a friend sent him a slingshot sans missiles as a gift.  She was surprised and told me that this slingshot was a gift "I presented to him."</seg>
<seg id="9"> She also joined a team to put out an electronic magazine centered around this star.  Joined by me, she enjoyed viewing every issue of it in great excitement.</seg>
<seg id="10"> I always like to make friends with people who frankly admit that they are fans of one star or another.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The stars could be a television celebrity, a popular ball player, or, of course, towering figures in other fields.</seg>
<seg id="12"> I never consider these friends shallow.  I think they are lovable.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Generally, they are honest and straightforward.  If they like a person, they say so outright.  If they dislike one, they also admit it.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Dealing with this type of people put you at ease.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Although they might not take your feelings one hundred percent into consideration.  But at least you know well what and how they feel, be it joy, anger, sadness or merriment.  You enjoy a sense of greater security when dealing with them.</seg>
<seg id="16"> These people are very frank and honest.</seg>
<seg id="17"> You should realize that dare to express one's likes and dislikes also takes courage.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Because of a lack of such courage, many people like another person all through their life but remain silent about it.  They might even look down on those who openly announce that they are fans of so and so.</seg>
<seg id="19"> I think, being frank is one of the most admired virtues of a person -- frank to one's friends and frank to oneself.</seg>
<seg id="20"> But to be truly frank is, in fact, very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="21"> If one is able to like a star, at least it proves that one has a unselfish streak in the heart.</seg>
<seg id="22"> Some of my friends are fans of one star or another.</seg>
<seg id="23"> To set eyes on this very star, they do not mind suffer inconveniences, miseries and even a great sacrifice.  They could go without meals or live a thrift life.  They could also hold big posters with the left hand, manipulate a camera in the right hand and, at the same time, shouting at the top of their voice.</seg>
<seg id="24"> You may call them foolish or childish, but they need to be selfless so that they can love without expecting any compensation,</seg>
<seg id="25"> Since in the real world too many people love only themselves, always consider themselves to be in the right and never say a good word for another person, this selflessness appears all the more rare and precious.</seg>
<seg id="26"> Therefore, when people get together to discuss which stars are their idol, and one of the people present would say that "I worship nobody,"</seg>
<seg id="27"> then, ha, ha, better be careful and on your guard.</seg>

<hl>
<seg id="1"> About Zhang Xiaohui</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Key term:  Zhang Xiaohui</seg>
<seg id="3"> By chance I saw one show of the serial, "Emperor Kangxi Comes," which I have not been watching for a long time.  Its leading star is Zhang Xiaohui.</seg>
<seg id="4"> I think it was around the time when "Peach Color" was being promoted.</seg>
<seg id="5"> I saw "Peach Color" when I was crazy about films of passion.</seg>
<seg id="6"> At that time, I really felt it odd that films of lust could be so aesthetic, and sometimes also quite interesting.  It is called films of passion.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Actually I have not seen too many of these films, but those I did see were filmed in quite a number of countries.</seg>
<seg id="8"> My earliest contacts were with films from Korea and Japan;</seg>
<seg id="9"> then, also many from third-world countries, and Latin American and European countries. But, on the other hand, I have not seen too many from Hollywood or from France.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Of them, two films were so worthy that I could not afford to delete.  One was "Adolescence" and the other "Peach Color."</seg>
<seg id="11"> The first half of "Peach Color" was quite good.  All hands were new and all worked hard. The director also knew how far to go and when to stop.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The second half was, however, somewhat abnormal.  I could not accept it at all.</seg>
<seg id="13"> In fact, what I want to say is: Zhang Xiaohui said on the program that her boy friends came from nearly all countries of the world except countries in Africa.</seg>
<seg id="14"> At the time, she had four boy friends.</seg>
<seg id="15"> This is something, I am afraid, people generally cannot accept. They would say that this person is too licentious.</seg>
<seg id="16"> But the key of the issue is: she was perfectly sincere and honest when uttering these words, leaving not an iota of bad taste or awkwardness in the listener.</seg>
<seg id="17"> She also talked about her own view and position on love.</seg>
<seg id="18"> For example: the other party must be financially independent.</seg>
<seg id="19"> I guess, she meant, independent also in personality and be able to control one's own destiny.</seg>
<seg id="20"> For I know that a person in love sees love as something on the move and something selfish. How can one permit the person one loves accept love from anybody else!</seg>
<seg id="21"> According to my experience, knowledge and forecast, Zhang Xiaohui is not experiencing simple emotional attachment, but, decidedly, typical affections between an elder sister and a younger brother.</seg>
<seg id="22"> In elder sister-kid brother love, the sister can be extremely tolerant and broad-minded. For example, the sister has several brothers all at the same time.  Meanwhile, the brother can love the sister insatiably because of her attraction and her motherliness, and do not mind such things as exclusiveness.</seg>
<seg id="23"> On the other hand, I also find in the remarks of Zhang Xiaohui that she, in fact, understands well how to enjoy life.</seg>
<seg id="24"> For instance, she loves travel to a fault.</seg>
<seg id="25"> Hence, I also have a reason to believe that her life is excellent and wonderful.</seg>
<seg id="26"> But before I am really so convinced, I might not be able to accept these things and happenings.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Just examine my case.  I have also accepted many people, without, in fact, being prejudiced by broad-mindedness or narrow-mindedness.  Once you see through the mist and fog, you know that love and hate are anything but absolute.</seg>
<seg id="28"> These people could be Passer-by A, Friend B, Miss Zhang Ziyi, Good Friend C, or Sister Hibiscus.</seg>
<seg id="29"> Looking at the life of others, you are no more than an onlooker. To an onlooker, aren't you the master of your own life?</seg>
<seg id="30"> This is like the situation that legends about myself have always been found in the Jiangnan region, even if I have not been there myself.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Men Need Spirit of Fun</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Key term: spirit of fun</seg>
<seg id="3"> For a man, life is very hard and burdensome.  Hence, he needs to have some fun.</seg>
<seg id="4"> You either laugh at yourself, watch others making a fool of themselves, or gossip about other people.</seg>
<seg id="5"> For example, you should go to "the end of the world (Tianya)," to take a look at the "Gossip for Fun" for a bit of relaxation.</seg>
<seg id="6"> In it, everybody has his say.  Naturally, as different shades of blackness in gossips are mongered endlessly, you should be able to distinguish truth from falsehood and the right from the wrong.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Speak out whenever you wish.  And you end up not knowing what you are talking about. But, you have to understand what are you seeing and reading.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Little S calls Cai Kang an intellectual, or one of the "people who read books."</seg>
<seg id="9"> If I can also be counted in this group, then I belong to those people who read a few books, but do not fully understand what they have read.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Luckily, I always know myself.</seg>
<seg id="11"> But, after all, I got what I wished to get when I read those few books.</seg>
<seg id="12"> And coincidentally, I like to think and let my thoughts run wild. I read when I think at the same time.  This enables me to see the meaning of things clearly all of a sudden.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Consequently, some good habits and attitudes are formed.  For instance, I often tell myself to be more strict and demanding on my self, but be kind to others.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Whenever problems or difficulties arise, first look inward for the cause and put the blame on myself.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Handle the business side rationally, but handle emotions, friendship  and feelings with empathy.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Behave and deal with fellow men in a low key. Execute businesses also in a low key.</seg>
<seg id="17"> But you know, people are not that good and usually tend to be selfish and calculating in matters of gain and loss. Oftentimes they are hopelessly emotional and sentimental just when the need of the hour is rationality.  And when they should use their heart and feelings, they often become God-damned rational.</seg>
<seg id="18"> But, the good thing about it is: one would not think of regretting the choices one makes.</seg>
<seg id="19"> When it is done, it is done. When you fall on your face, resign yourself to the mishap.</seg>
<seg id="20"> Why should you chew the nonsense over and again in your mind?</seg>
<seg id="21"> Not too bad, I am not a dour fellow who always try to show myself as a superior intellectual. I am just an ordinary and unrefined commoner.</seg>
<seg id="22"> Only a difference between me and some of my fellow men lies in the fact that I need not act as a cynic or a misanthrope.  I treat everything and all situations rationally.</seg>
<seg id="23"> And, perhaps, another example of the difference lies in my strong faith and profound convictions.</seg>
<seg id="24"> Once I trust a person, then, I believe everything he or she does is good.</seg>
<seg id="25"> Even if there are inadequacies in him or in her, I would be willing and glad to accept and tolerate them.</seg>
<seg id="26"> Even if I am not of the type that is chummy with friends who frequently get together in a lively and rousing way, I can be classified as one who always has his friends' interest on his mind.</seg>
<seg id="27"> But, as this is the case, I guard myself rather carefully against bad company.</seg>
<seg id="28"> Also, I could not understand at all why there are still so many people who believe what is said and acted upon in the newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="29"> Perhaps, in their mind news reports of today still have that quality of sacredness as they had in the olden days.</seg>
<seg id="30"> However, in this world, there are so many things that I cannot understand.</seg>
<seg id="31"> It's a joke!</seg>
<seg id="32"> I slap myself on the face.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Song Dandan "Depth of Happiness," Warm and Touching</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Key terms: Song Dandan, Depth of happiness</seg>
<seg id="3"> Sometime ago, I read a newspaper report about a newly published book by Song Dandan entitled "Depth of Happiness."</seg>
<seg id="4"> I was quite keen on reading it.</seg>
<seg id="5"> For I wish to know what views she -- as a woman of her age and profession, and having gone through unusual changes in family and career life -- has on herself and on life itself.</seg>
<seg id="6"> As expected, the book did not disappoint me at all. Going over it I was struck by two things.  First, the book thrilled and electrified me.  In the life of other people, I saw also my own shadow and image.  Secondly, I was deeply touched by detailed descriptions of affectionate life of the family.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Why was I electrified?</seg>
<seg id="8"> In the book Song Dandan wrote: "I neglected an important principle of life: To give is more fortunate than to receive.</seg>
<seg id="9"> I have always been busy giving, busy in making myself fortunate.</seg>
<seg id="10"> I don't want to receive and understand little of receiving.  I neglect giving others the opportunity to give, that is neglecting the rights of others to be fortunate.</seg>
<seg id="11"> I discovered that I myself also have enjoyed such good fortune all the time.  From here on, perhaps I should be more thoughtful in this regard.</seg>
<seg id="12"> If one can face his/her own past with openness and honesty, and bare all and everything before the public, that would have called for considerable courage.</seg>
<seg id="13"> In her book she wrote about, among other things, her first love, her collapsed marriage with Yingda, penetrating analysis of herself as well as the affections between herself and her son</seg>
<seg id="14"> There is another matter related to this book which is worthy of praise. In the beginning, the publisher must have strongly urged her to lay greater emphasis on "I Love My Sweet Home," and "Lay Ambush in Ten Directions" as well as a series of short essays on Zhao Benshan.</seg>
<seg id="15"> But, I think she must have held firm to her principles.  Only casual mention of Zhao Benshan appeared at the end. As to "Ambush" and "I Love My Home," both were hardly touched on.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Throughout the entire book, the reader finds brimful of descriptions of how a 40-year-old woman understands and feels about her own life, love, family and kinship affections. It is warm and touching.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Busy Vacation</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Key terms: vacation, busy</seg>
<seg id="3"> Vacation started a week ago.  But since then, there has not been one idle moment either.</seg>
<seg id="4"> I took part in a conference at the academy. Then, I also must gather needed materials for a meeting next week, including drafting a paper to be delivered on that occasion.</seg>
<seg id="5"> I will be very busy in this vacation.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Provided that nothing goes out of control, my plans call for the attendance of three conferences and visits to four or five cities.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Life is fully packed with much content. Some items are similar to each other, others are of various types.  I almost forgot how vacations in past years were spent.</seg>
<seg id="8"> My memories seem to indicate that earlier vacations also were not all spent in idleness.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Only, in earlier vacations I was in control over the use of long periods of free time.  But this year such time has been much curtailed.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Is it a good or a bad thing?</seg>
<seg id="11"> Busy times generally make for a fuller life.  But getting busy for nothing or only for a meager harvest, imposes a discount on the value of the packed work schedules.</seg>
<seg id="12"> However, it seems that there are times when life cannot be evaluated entirely on the criteria of effect produced. Life is to be slowly experienced. To walk on solid ground, to ensure safety and stability in life, and to live fully and pleasantly constitute one sort of worthy accomplishment, even though they cannot be expressed on a scale of social benefits.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The worth of every individual is assessed on a scale of social value and on a scale of personal value.  If one is to be assessed only on one but not on both scales, what should we do?</seg>
<seg id="14"> Marxism tells us that the scale of social value should be the top choice, for Marxism advocates contributions by the individual to the society. In reality, however, a healthy and sound society also should fully respect the wishes and values of the individual, and should even create favorable conditions for the realization of personal values.</seg>
<seg id="15"> This question suddenly caught my interest and attention. More and more clearly I found that Marxist principles really are effective.</seg>
<seg id="16"> These principles are indeed valid.  But in real life, people sometimes cannot help getting confused.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Even if realization of personal values does not infringe on the realization of social values, would every individual in the real world be satisfied with the realization of himself?  And would he ignore or even set social values aside?</seg>
<seg id="18"> Or, can the satisfaction of realizing one's personal values be divorced from social values assessment?</seg>
<seg id="19"> That is very difficult, it seems.</seg>
<seg id="20"> Consequently, after working hard to live a good ordinary life, every one of us cannot help pursuing excellence and the extraordinary.  Failing that, we would blame ourselves for wasting our life.</seg>
<seg id="21"> Probably, this is one facet of the social man.</seg>
<seg id="22"> Now the vacation has begun, the days do become more or less relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="23"> At least, I have time to watch an occasional video show, or relax and play a while,</seg>
<seg id="24"> and chat a little.   There's still work to be done, and a life to live.</seg>
<seg id="25"> Next week, I have to go away again, to a conference in Xi-an.</seg>
<seg id="26"> Although I have never visited Xi-an, the city is not much to my liking, because of some prejudices I have picked up.</seg>
<seg id="27"> I hope this forthcoming trip could change my impressions of this city.  Ho, Ho!</seg>

<seg id="1"> "Highly Feministic Life"</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Key terms: men, feminism era</seg>
<seg id="3"> In the afternoon Ying phoned. We talked for a while and brought up me watching "Pleasant Male Voice."</seg>
<seg id="4"> Ying said: "It couldn't be true! You are too cute!  Super Female Voice followed by Pleasant Male Voice, you are a real loyal audience of the Hunan Satellite Television."</seg>
<seg id="5"> I admitted that she was right.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Ying said she watched some talent hunt programs featuring male performers. She considers them bunch of feminine males. I agree with her, but told her that "Pleasant Male Voice" has reached a 5-rising-to-4 rating and would score 4-rising-to-3 next week.  The vocals were really good.  Every one tumbled over the other in their climb to the summit.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Ying, a student of popular and consumer subcultures, also became excited and said she would watch that program next week.  After all, when competition is reaching its most crucial final climax, the show will become most spectacular. Taking a look at it could very well help a researcher collect materials on interesting cases essential for future research projects.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Then, our conversation turned to the topic: arrival of the age of male sexual appeal.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Men finally changed their status from the "observer" to the "observed." Women, who played the role of "guest" in the past, have now become the "master," who can, as spectators, face down and enjoy various types of shows of the age of male sexual appeal which feature a cast of male stars.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Ying said, that is liberation of women, and a signpost of feminism.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Then, she added: "Don't you think you are leading a highly feministic life?"</seg>
<seg id="12"> Upon hearing Ying's remarks, I burst out into loud laughter of joy.</seg>
<seg id="13"> These words are 100 percent feministic in themselves.  But, it takes somebody better than I, somebody like Ying, who has such superior faculties of deliberation and discrimination, to explain and illuminate these things clearly and in great depth.</seg>
<seg id="14"> In "Pleasant Male Voice" I like very much the songs of Chen Chusheng which are of excellent quality capable of penetrating time and space in the direction of your heart.   Very pure, clean and comforting.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Songs by Su Xing are varied in form and presented with a great deal of feeling.  His looks are elegant and graceful. Meanwhile, he carries himself vivaciously and lightheartedly.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Zhang Jie's songs are extremely powerful and resonant. Particularly, the two songs, "Your Looks" and "Yesterday Is Blown Away," on today's program are my old favorites impressively presented.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Wei Chen who closely resembles Lu Yi, has a lovely face pure and clear. He is believed to be very popular among young girls.  Naturally, his voice is quite presentable.</seg>
<seg id="18"> With four top stars of this stature racing further upward to the summit, the show should be tremendously worth watching.</seg>
<seg id="19"> We are looking forward to watching their sensational shows next week!</seg>

<seg id="1"> Topsy-turvy "Pickled Cabbage Mood" on June 29</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Key terms: pickled cabbage, Seoul</seg>
<seg id="3"> Topsy-turvy "Pickled Cabbage Mood" on June 29. I have international roaming, but, upon getting off the plane, I found it was like the power was cut on my cell phone. Not even one line of signals was shown. Perhaps for Quanqiutong, its coverage meant the influence sphere of the heart. And the coverage would take effect on the day of your next payment.</seg>
<seg id="4"> For the coming days, I would temporarily lose contact with you all. ha, ha, will anybody worry about me because of this?</seg>
<seg id="5"> I opened the "secretary" in order to ascertain who was thinking of me,</seg>
<seg id="6"> no matter the thoughts were of business or of private life.</seg>
<seg id="7"> But, the question was: "Who do I wish would be thinking of me?"</seg>
<seg id="8"> My heart has turned blank and empty. And I don't know the time this began to happen.</seg>
<seg id="9"> I do not understand why some people would go away even if you want to keep them, while others believe they can elbow their way in despite your wish to get rid of them. Does it not sound and feel like a scene in the marketplace?</seg>
<seg id="10"> But, the heart. Can you fill the heart with the "white glove" type of substitutes even if you are not allocated any room in that heart?</seg>
<seg id="11"> After all, material things and the heart just cannot be discussed on the same terms!</seg>
<seg id="12"> Our car runs on the high speed freeway leading to Pusan.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The Minister does not say a word when he is driving.  Neither do I have anything to say.</seg>
<seg id="14"> After all, he understands neither Chinese nor English.  And I can only say a few, a few sentences in Pidgin English.</seg>
<seg id="15"> I am bored watching the computer screen and working the keyboard. Inside the car, only the clicking on the keyboard and the pleasant voice of young Korean ladies from the GPRS navigation system. All is deadly quiet.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Outside the car window, what is left for you to watch is an endless stretch of green and a grayish sky.</seg>
<seg id="17"> For me, keeping quiet seems to be out of character.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Unexpectedly, the only thing that makes me feel at home in this country is the English language.</seg>
<seg id="19"> The eye-full of circles makes you nothing else but dizzy.</seg>
<seg id="20"> I think, Korea definitely would not make compasses,</seg>
<seg id="21"> because there is no demand of compasses in the market.</seg>
<seg id="22"> Seoul is clean, thoroughly clean, meticulously clean.</seg>
<seg id="23"> Only, it is too bad that in the few days in Seoul I have had no time to visit any place outside the workplace and department stores. All my impressions are gained through what I see along the roads I travel.</seg>
<seg id="24"> Luckily, everything is still nice and beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="25"> The Korean people are strictly observing traditional courtesy, smiling methodically, and listening seriously. They are refined and quiet.</seg>
<seg id="26"> All that meet the eye are the beautiful surface layer, traditional customs, old style architecture and a national culture that is trembling with fear.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Is that hypocrisy?</seg>
<seg id="28"> Maybe a little hypocrisy is okay. At least all would observe decorum.</seg>
<seg id="29"> When ugly things are not in sight, people would think that they do not exist.</seg>
<seg id="30"> Korean food and drinks are very good.</seg>
<seg id="31"> However, I don't like and don't understand why all the changes back and forth involve only the presentation of pickled vegetables in various forms and on different combination platters. It goes without saying, seaweed is an indispensable ingredient of all and every dish.</seg>
<seg id="32"> Now, let's look at things from another angle. The Korean people are really tops doing research on food and drinks. They can tell apart the pickled cabbage made and stored on the surface of the earth and that made and stored underground; and can determine with measured-by-the-minute precision the age of pickled cabbage.</seg>
<seg id="33"> All these constitute circumstantial evidences that the Korean national character of meticulousness has something to do with their use of pickled cabbage from early morning to late evening.</seg>
<seg id="34"> But, I am worried. As the Minister is about taking us to that Japanese tofu restaurant, I wonder how will its cook combine pickled vegetables with his specialties.</seg>
<seg id="35"> Recalling the Chinese food we had last night, I feel like crying. It is completely "Koreanized" and the only thing that could pass muster was pickled cabbage.</seg>
<seg id="36"> Ah huh, thanks to the China Southern Airline for the pickled cabbage it offered on the in-flight menu.</seg>
<seg id="37"> The airline must have presumed that I wish to accustom myself to the Korean delicacy right from the time I board the Korea-bound aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="38"> There are two more days to go before I return home. In case I still have nobody on my mind, I'd do well thinking of our maid who serves a dish of good Chinese pork stew.</seg>
<seg id="39"> After all, to fill one's stomach is more direct and immediate fulfillment than to satisfy the needs of the heart.</seg>
<seg id="40"> Naturally, this point has nothing to do with pickled cabbage.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Two Trees</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> There are two trees. One is me; one is my brother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="3"> We provide each other shade, and help and care for each other.</seg>
<seg id="4"> In my generation, families bring up many sons and daughters.  But I have no brothers, only sisters -- elder and younger sisters. Therefore, it apparently appears to be a very important occasion when a brother-in-law arrives.</seg>
<seg id="5"> We were children from poor families who had to do the countless household chores ever since very young ages. I tried hard to put up a grown-up faÃ§ade and  to perform like a skillful old hand, but, what I did never could win a nod of approval from my Dad.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Ever since early childhood, I have been bothered by the symptoms of sleepwalking, which were not very serious.  But, while doing house work, the wondering mind inevitably pop up, now and then.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Once Dad wanted me to apply some plaster on the chimney of our old house. I hurried up to the top of the roof to do the job.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The plastering job was done. But when it rained, the roof sprang a leak because I stepped on a few tiles and broke them.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Another instance began as Dad asked me to replace a light bulb, an old-fashioned unfrosted light bulb.</seg>
<seg id="10"> After I climbed up a stool, the new bulb slipped out of my hand dropped down to the cement floor and was smashed.</seg>
<seg id="11"> I lost count of such little incidents. Consequent to the numerous blunders I committed, my brother-in-law, soon after being welcomed to the house, took over house chores, all and sundry, as a matter of course. And, he did them with flying colors at hardly any labor cost.</seg>
<seg id="12"> As to me, it meant happy times to hide myself in a corner of the house to enjoy "xian shu," (books for killing time) which looks and feels like bricks.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Later on, we grew into two big trees that are strong enough to support the building that was our family.</seg>
<seg id="14"> But, my father, on the other hand, inevitably saw his stature began and kept on shrinking. Finally, Dad in the wheel chair became a thick growth of shrubs that stays quiet and unnoticed in the deep shade.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Unexpectedly, fate, like the weather, suddenly altered its course. The 50-year-old brother-in-law, all of a sudden, was afflicted with a serious disease.  Still looking luxuriant, this huge tree, however, was drawing incredibly close to its horrible end, death.</seg>
<seg id="16"> On a dazzling summer day, outside the operating room of the Beijing Union Hospital, the surgeon casually said: The case is not worth operating.</seg>
<seg id="17"> He has, at the most, two more months to live.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Right at this instant, I was dumfound, feeling like being struck by a stray bullet that separated my soul from the body.</seg>
<seg id="19"> Again, somnambulism began to rear its head. I saw the courtyard of our old house and my young brother-in-law busily moving about there.</seg>
<seg id="20"> Then, awakened by a shrilling cry from my elder sister, I hurried to the hallway in the hospital where she fell down and sat on the ground. I helped her up and embraced her while tears streamed down our cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="21"> The dazzling sun suddenly disappeared. And the scene just in front of my eyes turned black in fits and starts.</seg>
<seg id="22"> After coming back to our hometown, my brother-in-law soon found out the true condition of his illness.  Holding my sister in his arms, he joined her in a good and unrestrained cry.  After that, he unexpectedly regained his calm and freedom from anxieties.</seg>
<seg id="23"> My brother-in-law began methodically to make arrangements for the family for the time after his departure from this world.  For instance, he would tell his son to "take good care of the Grandma on behalf of me."  "After Grandma passes away, bury her remains in your Grandpa's grave."  And he gave instructions on how to open that grave to prepare for the burial of both grandparents together.</seg>
<seg id="24"> "Pay frequent visits on your maternal grandfather.  Bring him useful and practical gifts on New Year's and other festival holidays."</seg>
<seg id="25"> Also, he told my younger sister "to visit your elder sister often after I am gone.  All by herself, she must be very lonely and lonesome."</seg>
<seg id="26"> I tried to allocate as much time as possible to visit with him.  He was usually embarrassed when we were together face to face.</seg>
<seg id="27"> We often faced each other silently, as two trees would.  Though living, they cannot talk to each other.</seg>
<seg id="28"> They are two grown-up trees. Wind-swept and rain-soaked, we are past masters of facing the world of trials and tribulations. Was it still necessary for him to tell me anything more?</seg>
<seg id="29"> It seemed unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id="30"> For your heart understands: After you are gone, my sister, and the children you two brought to this world, in fact, the entire family, will have to lean on me, one of the two trees left standing.</seg>
<seg id="31"> Who makes the decision that I be born a man!</seg>
<seg id="32"> As a man, you must, like it or not, resolutely keep your backbone upright and lift the burdens up on your shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="33"> The only regret I have is: why did you, the other tree, wither away so early when you should still live a life of abundance and luxuriant growth in your sun-set years that were to come?</seg>
<seg id="34"> You departed this world on the New Year's Day on the lunar calendar.</seg>
<seg id="35"> That is the festival spring holiday celebrated by Chinese communities all over the world.   But, you took your leave, all alone.</seg>
<seg id="36"> Perhaps, in another world and under a new framework of time and space, is another new life being born?</seg>

<seg id="1"> N Minutes in Life</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The reason that I came up with such a seemingly fashionable title is that the befuddled brain had no time to trifle with counting the minutes when the world was plunging into the depth of utter despair.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Like an innocent person suddenly receives, out of the blue, a court sentence of capital punishment. Will he try to pick out, in a leisurely manner, the grammatical mistakes in the text of the sentence?</seg>
<seg id="4"> On a winter day, it was very cold in the youth hostel.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Nobody knew who was on duty.  Throughout the day, the stove remained unlit.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Since a strong earthquake was said to be imminent, we did not bother to kindle the stove when we returned to our den early in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="7"> On the long bunk which could accommodate 12 people, the four of us, bundled in cotton quilts, and shivering all over from severe cold, were playing the poker game "Three to One" under dim light, betting with our meal coupons.</seg>
<seg id="8"> All of a sudden, a noise which started far away was rolling nearer and nearer.  In a split second, we exchanged staring glances and realized that catastrophe was descending on us.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Consequently, throwing away the cards in our hand, jumping down from the bunk, together we dashed through two narrow doors out of the room.</seg>
<seg id="10"> At the very blink we cleared the dormitory building, the poor hut of piled-up stone was instantaneously pulverized.</seg>
<seg id="11"> After dashing into the courtyard, we found the ground swinging under our feet the way a boat does. Like a toy tumbler, the world rocked back and forth unable to find a firm footing.</seg>
<seg id="12"> In a matter of seconds, buildings all around us, contrary to its old image of solid stability, creaked, whined, performed the mad dance number, "Thunderclap," and finally turned themselves into a spiral of smoke and floating dust in an act of suicide.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The power-lines above our head, naturally, would like to join the crowd.  They snapped with a sharp cracking sound, and, like horse whips, flew wildly in all directions.</seg>
<seg id="14"> And all around us, the devastating earth tremors were celebrating their novel accomplishment with fireworks.  Multi-colored flashes of light emissions from the earth easily beat the special effects of all elaborate blockbuster war movies in beauty and impressiveness. Sounds of the earthquake rolling on in all directions like the beating of battle-field drums severely strained one's nerves.</seg>
<seg id="15"> At that juncture, everybody had the same idea on his mind: "The last day for mankind has arrived!"</seg>
<seg id="16"> I could imagine that a yawning gap was opening up on the ground under our feet. There in, boiling lava hissed like molten iron to issue a fiery invitation. Innumerable numbers of humans, looking like ants, were dropping down into the lava in a free fall. They disappeared in a split second, without being generous enough to leave behind even a streak of blue smoke.</seg>
<seg id="17"> My spine became happily numb as if someone had injected ice water in the column. In the darkness, faces of my companions looked like paper masks drifting and floating about unsteadily.</seg>
<seg id="18"> I asked myself: Is mankind taking leave of this beautiful and interesting world? Is the civilization of myriads of years to be completely wiped out overnight?</seg>
<seg id="19"> But, I am not yet 20 years old. The flower of youth has just started to blossom. The delight of life is barely discovered. Oh, how reluctant I am to say goodbye to this world!</seg>
<seg id="20"> Oh, my dad, mom and all my loved ones, where are you? What are you doing at this moment?  Are you still alive?</seg>
<seg id="21"> Faced with the terrifying and gloating smiles of the God of Death, how I yearn over all of you!</seg>
<seg id="22"> . . . . I did not know how long this lasted.  Finally, the empty-headed me was delighted to discover that the rolling noise transmitted through the ground was gradually diminishing, earth tremors were slowing down and the smoke and spark overhead also stopped blinking.</seg>
<seg id="23"> The huge ship tumbling in the sky-high waves and frightful storm was finally inching her way into a peaceful harbor.</seg>
<seg id="24"> Having just weathered a maddening battle, a young and easily breakable heart was finally and carefully returned to its original position.</seg>
<seg id="25"> Oh my earth! My home and garden! Finally, you made us feel again the warmth and care of our home!</seg>
<seg id="26"> Born of our survival of a catastrophe, a feeling of joy and good fortune slowly spread out from both heels upward through the entire body</seg>
<seg id="27"> After regaining his foothold, Yu Doudou who was barely 17 years old, suddenly cried out loud. For he simply could not bear to see the once warm and harmonious youth hostel now reduced to a huge pile of debris and ruins.</seg>
<seg id="28"> The highly contagious mood was transmitted to all people present. And tears swelled into a torrent.</seg>
<seg id="29"> Snow began to fall down from the firmament. Was it expressing sadness and mourning for the victimized mankind?</seg>
<seg id="30"> That year, earthquake took more than 1,000 lives in Haicheng.</seg>
<seg id="31"> Some experts say it was extremely fortunate that there were timely forecasts and that the quake took place before most people went to bed.  Otherwise, the quake measuring 7.3 on the Richter scale would have taken a toll of at least one hundred thousand lives</seg>
<seg id="32"> Only one year later, an earthquake shook up Tangshan and killed more than 200,000 people.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Things Happened in Village</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In the village there are many families.  Of them, the family named Nan is the most disliked.  A well-known phrase widely circulated in the village says: "Guard against fire, robbers and the Nans."</seg>
<seg id="3"> In fact, the whole Nan clan may be counted as relatively honest.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Ordinarily, some families would swipe something, such as melons, from the field of other people.  All that the Nan family does are no worse than pilfering a chicken or stealing a dog.  It shouldn't have come to the point that the whole village shuns and tries to isolate the Nan family.</seg>
<seg id="5"> No body is clean. Who have we of the Nan clan offended?</seg>
<seg id="6"> The Nan family has begun to engage in a number of prideful activities, demonstrating that the village, in its earliest beginning, was founded by ancestors of the Nan clan which has always been a large grain producing household.  Moreover, it has produced quite a number of celebrities in history, and, additionally, made important contributions to the development and construction in the village.</seg>
<seg id="7"> In the meantime, members of the Nan family warmly and anxiously invite cadres of the village to come for visits and to look around.</seg>
<seg id="8"> All in all, members of the entire Nan clan strive for progress resolutely. They want to take the initiative in a battle and to strive for power and strength.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Not very long ago, the Xi family did something that was rather mean: -- cruelly persecuting the young sprouts of the Nan family.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The family named Xi is well known in the whole village through their work of match-making. All young men benefited from such work by the Xi family.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Without the good match-making service performed by Xi family members, how can you, members of all families, do a good job in production?</seg>
<seg id="12"> But in recent days members of the Xi family, to the surprise of other villagers, used black bricks to squeeze out the life of young sprouts brought forth by the Nan family.  That action was extremely abominable.  The whole village rose in anger and said that the Xi family did not even have one good and decent family member.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The Nans demanded that the Xi family give them an explanation.  That touched off a wave of sympathy and support for the Nans throughout the village.</seg>
<seg id="14"> One after another, virtually all villagers spit on the members of the Xi family.</seg>
<seg id="15"> This way, the battlefield is transferred to the Xi family.</seg>
<seg id="16"> The Nan family made a firm decision to give a good shine to the image of the clan before the opening of the 17th Plenary Conference of the village. They wanted to help the clan, which had more members than other clans in the village, to grow and prosper in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Although cadres of the village try, day in and day out, to persuade everybody to keep inter-personal relationships harmonious, life in the place that we know as Zhong Village, however, is far from peaceful and tranquil.</seg>
<seg id="18"> In a short period of two to three months, the most irritating thing that happened is the revolt proclaimed boisterously by the pigs. Even pigs wish to raise themselves in others' esteem.</seg>
<seg id="19"> Two years ago, chickens spread bird flu in many villages.  Weren't they all liquidated?</seg>
<seg id="20"> Poor pig, don't you have brains in the head?</seg>
<seg id="21"> Don't you dare to further instigate a revolution! That will deny you a chance to escape the fate of decapitation.</seg>
<seg id="22"> In the Village of Mei and in the Village of Ying, two habitual bullies, life has been blessed by wealth and abundance but not necessarily by peace and harmony.</seg>
<seg id="23"> In the Village of Mei, some vagabonds knock down a couple of skyscrapers today.  Tomorrow they throw boxfuls of dynamite on underground rail tracks in the Village of Ying.  These are frightening enough, aren't they?</seg>
<seg id="24"> These things have enabled people in the Villages of Shang and Zhong to reach the following conclusion: Though they cannot afford decent housing, sick calls, medical care and opportunities to receive education, they are able to work on farms and in factories and can build up their social network in peace and good conscience.  This means these villages have already ushered in the modern age.</seg>
<seg id="25"> There are the Nan family, the Xi family, and many others.  Which one of them can claim to be completely free from difficulties and problems?</seg>
<seg id="26"> Take a look at the Wan family in the southeastern part of the village.  Though the head of this clan is shameless and dishonorable, our great Village of Zhong, still takes good care of them just the same?</seg>
<seg id="27"> The Inter-Village Games of 2008 will be held in our Village of Zhong very soon.  Let some of the unworthy problems in the village be cleared away.  And let the naughty children of the village be disciplined.</seg>
<seg id="28"> Let all the families and households light their lamps and kindle their fires.  Let the wealthy chip in with their monies and the able-bodied pledge their muscle power.</seg>
<seg id="29"> When the time comes, let us go to the bird nest to see the gold eggs.</seg>
<seg id="30"> (sound effect off screen, phasing out: gold eggs or silver eggs?  Friends in the audience, the audience,  This is Yongge, a program host of the Village TV Station)</seg>

<seg id="1"> Eric Looks at Google China</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Key words: Eric, Google, Google China.  Author: an ordinary Google employee</seg>
<seg id="3"> I am an employee who joined Google China rather early.  In the recent two years we went through a lot of tests. Some of them were expected beforehand, but others, for sure, happened unexpectedly.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Yesterday, since the corporate earnings report of this quarter, it is learned, would devote a special chapter to reporting developments in China, and, by chance, heard corporate CEO, Eric's answer to a question about China.  The remarks by Eric provided me with a lot of food for thought which I have just located and am sharing with you now.</seg>
<seg id="5"> These remarks were made in the Google Inc. Second Quarter 2007 Earnings Conference Call last week.(http://investor.google.com/earnings.html )  In answer to a reporter's question CEO Eric said he was completely satisfied with current accomplishments of Google China and had a full measure of confidence in Google's future development in the Chinese market.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Eric said: In China we have excellent talents, constantly upgraded  equipment and installations as well as incessantly enriched and localized production lines.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Predicting no immediate and surefire success just in front of our eyes, Eric, however, said Google China already had a very good start. And, with hard work by the Chinese team, generous support from the headquarters and plenty of perseverance, he was convinced that Google China will certainly achieve astonishing results in the future.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Yes, it is essential that we march onward and upward resolutely, for we were born and brought up here and we are deeply attached to this place.  We firmly believe that Google should give a great deal more to China and to its customers.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Slippers without Strings</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Now, for whatever merchandise, top-less is all the rage, especially in the summer. Everyone wishes to run around in the nude, for any piece of clothing would make the wearer that much hotter.</seg>
<seg id="3"> You probably learned sometime ago that T-back which was popular for quite a number of years was knocked out by G-String, because the latter has no string at all.</seg>
<seg id="4"> For the same reason, and in this day, the slippers you are wearing will quite likely become out-dated, because a brand new type, the string-less slipper, has made its appearance. It consists of nothing else but the sole.</seg>
<seg id="5"> How to wear that without a string?</seg>
<seg id="6"> We are not God. Manufacturers also have no magic.</seg>
<seg id="7"> This kind of slippers is directly glued to the sole: This is not prank, but real merchandise. Its selling price is around US$13.5 per pair.</seg>
<seg id="8"> This is another kind of "I have imagined it could exist, but never dreamed of its real existence" product. It leaves me speechless.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Manufacturers consider this kind of slippers to be extremely cool. Don't you believe them?</seg>
<seg id="10"> Please take a look.  Just glancing at it is enough to make the sole of my feet extremely uncomfortable. [via F.C]</seg>

<seg id="2"> Key word:  Beautiful woman</seg>
<seg id="3"> Grand opening of the China Digital Entertainment Expo & Conference (Chinajoy) took place on July 12, with a daily average of 40,000 visitors.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Large numbers of local enterprises participated in this year's conference as exhibitors.  Most of them are showing web surfing.</seg>
<seg id="5"> I believe, among the addictive high technologies for mature readers and users, "showgirl" has greater attractive power than internet surfing.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Don't be impatient. The entrÃ©e will be served right away.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Lenovo to Debut High-End ThinkPad T61p Soon</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Key word: Lenovo ThinkPad</seg>
<seg id="3"> Lenovo will introduce ThinkPad T61p, its top notebook model of the T series, on July 17 (US time). We are quite pleasantly surprised. UWB (Wisair Ultra Wideband)</seg>
<seg id="4"> That's right. Like the R400 notebook, it is connected to a high speed wireless expansion slot.</seg>
<seg id="5"> (via) This 15.4-inch notebook PC is fitted with a Santa Rosa CPU and a Nvidia Quadro FX 570M graphics chip set. Of course, the T61 reinforced metal cage is included. And the price tag of about RMB 15,000 is lower than expected.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Watching Blockbusters without Wide Screen; Pictures of Cell Phone Projector Revealed</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Key term: cell phone</seg>
<seg id="3"> The Korean company Iljin Display is introducing a coin-sized laser projector module.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Due to its extremely small size, the projector module, capable of creating a 7-in display area on the wall, can be installed inside a cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="5"> A traditional projector has three different LCD panels to project respectively three different, namely red, green, and blue, video signals. But this tiny projector needs only one LCD panel to switch back and forth among the three colors, thus reduces both the size and the production cost of the projector.</seg>
<seg id="6"> An official statement said since the LCD panel used in this projector module measures only 0.24 inches, the module can be integrated easily inside a cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Now, over half of the cell phones on the market have cameras built in. And it is foreseen that cell phones with built-in projectors will appear on the market very soon. But it is really very difficult to predict if the market will or will not receive this new device with enthusiasm.</seg>
